"23","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"I am disabled for 17 years and have been on Medicare/Medicaid for 14 years. Over the past 17 years I have had over 29 surgeries, 9 on them on my spine, the remainder on joints, and a multitude of other health issues. My spine was fragmenting and it couldnt be stopped so they fused it both from the front and back basically building a wall around it to keep it secure. However it continues to degenerate and I live with alot of nuts and screws and plates holding it together, that in itself is painful, I have screws goign down into my SI joints and have SI joint dysfunction along with RA and Failed Spine Surgery Syndrome. I currently have another herniated disc, bulging disc and nerve damage. I live with chronic pain every day of my life but have never asked for a higher dose of pain medication, nor have I have lost a prescription, ran out of drugs early. My opioids give me some relief from the suffering. However due to this war against humanity, I am now being taken off my pain meds and my pain has increased, I have had to get help to get off the toilet. I used to be able to do that alone. I have no other options, I have been through every type of treatment, been through PT, so many injections of steroids I couldn't begin to count. I am no longer a candidate for further surgery due to my risk of infection so I will continue to fall apart and now I will do that without the relief of the pain meds that once made my life bearable, they gave me the ability to stand on my own two feet, to go to the bathroom by myself, now I can barely walk. I just want to be a daughter, a mother and a grandmother. To take part in my families lives instead of being stuck in my home because my pain is so unbearable I cant get myself up to join the world. WHERE IS THE HUMANITY IN THIS? THIS IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE POOR AND DISABLED

Opioids have given me some quality of life, made it so that I can walk, I can stand up so that I can toilet myself
These proposed regulations are not supported by any real science
If enacted doctors will be forced away from treating people like me, making us suffer, going against their Hippocratic Oath to DO NO HARM
If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day this will give insurance companies and pharmacies an excuse to stop paying for my necessary medications
Ive already been reading articles about chronic pain patients committing suicide rather than dealing with their pain situation, is this what our government really wants? Are you just trying to weed out this population of the damaged and the suffering? thats how it seems, get rid of the suffering...

I recently read a post somewhere that had something from the Declaration of Montreal and it said that 
WITHHOLDING PAIN TREATMENT IS PROFOUNDLY WRONG
THAT WITHHOLDING SUCH TREATMENT LEADS TO UNNECESSARY SUFFERING
THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAIN TREATMENT WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION
IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE-NOT INHIBIT-THE ACCESS OF PEOPLE IN PAIN TO FULLY ADEQUATE PAIN TREATMENT

Please reconsider-there has to be other options that doesnt hurt those that havent done anything wrong, all we do is try to make it from one day to the next-take the time to find a better way-slow down-stop causing more pain, start thinking about the BIG picture-

.  
Preventing Medicare members from getting appropriate pain relief medications will force them to use more emergent care facilities and or more frequent visits to their own providers to gain access to the pain relief.  
Although it is agreed that SOME Medicare members are addicted to opioids and SOME may have started their addiction from prescribed opioids thru their medical providers for needed services the reality is this group of citizens is not the focus group for drug addiction and this regulation is counterproductive
.
The only thing that this is going to do is drive the members, in real need, to seek opioids in either nefarious ways or force some to pay out of pocket or remain in pain or as I suggested seek care in ""Ready-care"" type facilities or even actual EDs when the pain can no longer be tolerated
Tying our hands as clinicians is the wrong approach.  

We need access to drugs that can be EASILY accessed to help these as well as all patients.  We are fine with limiting the initial numbers of pain medications for post-surgical or post event-related situations BUT we then need to have drugs approved thru the DEA for us to easily aid the patients when the small amount of initial opioids has been insufficient and they truly do need more

We used to have this in the form of Vicodin (hydrocodone) but when it was moved from Schedule 3 to 2 we lost the ability to call in the drug for either after hours or weekend or other such need.  Now the ONLY way to assist a patient in pain is to physically see them which costs them more and doesn't stop the prescription of the drug.  Surely this bill isn't trying to totally prevent a patient in pain from getting their drug so what is the intent once the small number is exceeded and more is in need?  Surely the answer is not ""let them suffer""

We need a comprehensive solution NOT a knee-jerk penalty based response that shifts the blame rather than helping the needy and monitoring the otherwise potential addict.

"41","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The US opioid epidemic has changed profoundly in the last 3 years, in ways that require substantial
recalibration of the US policy response.  
Heroin and fentanyl have come to dominate an escalating epidemic of lethal opioid overdose, whereas opioids
commonly obtained by prescription play a minor role, accounting for no more than 15% of reported
deaths in 2015.  The observed changes in the
opioid epidemic are particularly remarkable because they have emerged despite sustained reductions in
opioid prescribing and sustained reductions in prescription opioid misuse. Among US adults, past-year
prescription opioid misuse is at its lowest level since 2002. A credible epidemiologic account of the opioid epidemic is as follows: although opioid prescribing by physicians appears to have unleashed the epidemic prior to 2012, physician prescribing  no longer plays a major role in sustaining it. The accelerating pace of the opioid epidemic in 2015-2016
requires a serious reconsideration of governmental policy initiatives that continue to focus on reductions
in opioid prescribing. The dominant priority should be the assurance of subsidized access to evidencebased
medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Such treatment is lacking across much of the
United States at this time. Further aggressive focus on prescription reduction is likely to obtain
diminishing returns while creating significant risks for patients.

Dear Ms. Seema Verma,

Novo Nordisk Inc. (""Novo Nordisk"") appreciates the opportunity to comment on the 2019 Advance Notice and draft Call Letter (the draft Call Letter). Headquartered in Denmark, and with almost 5,000 U.S. employees, Novo Nordisk is a global health care company with 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes, obesity, hemophilia and growth hormone disorders. Novo Nordisk is committed to the goal of ensuring patients have access to high-quality, affordable health care, and to improving patient protections in health insurance coverage. 

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS' efforts to promote and enhance the quality of health plan offerings in both the MA and Part D programs. Our comment letter addresses the following points: 

	Novo Nordisk supports the adoption of a new measure for 2019 Star Ratings, ""Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes,"" but encourages additional emphasis on the link between cardiovascular disease and diabetes through future measure development.
	Novo Nordisk supports CMS' proposal to delay the summer formulary update window from July to late summer to allow plan sponsors to include newly approved drugs in 2019 bids. Novo Nordisk also supports the proposal to add two new enhancement-only windows in fall 2018 and January 2019 that will feed into the Medicare Plan Finder and ensure beneficiaries have the most current information. 

Novo Nordisk addresses these comments in more detail below.


Section I - Parts C and D: 
Enhancements to the 2019 Star Ratings and Future Measurement Concepts - New Measures for 2019 Star Ratings
Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) (Part D)

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS for the adoption of a Star Ratings Measure for 2019 to support statin use in persons living with diabetes. Statin use in patients living with diabetes is an evidence-based standard of care. The adoption of this Star Ratings measure will align with both the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of medical care in diabetes.  Patients with Type 2 diabetes have an increased prevalence of lipid abnormalities, contributing to their high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in subjects with and without coronary heart disease.  The USPSTF recommends that adults without a history of CVD (i.e., symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke) use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: 1) they are ages 40 to 75 years; 2) they have 1 or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking); and 3) they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater.  The USPSTF has rated statin use in patients with diabetes with ""B"" grade.  This grade denotes that the USPSTF recommends the service and there is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate.  The ADA recommends statin use of varying levels of intensity in all patients with diabetes (barring medical conditions resulting in a contraindication of statin use), recognizing that CVD is a dangerous co-morbidity of diabetes that must be appropriately treated.  

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS for updating the 2019 Star Ratings to include this measure on statin use as the measure aligns with evidence-based care and is in tune with the medical community's views on diabetes care. However, we encourage CMS to consider funding additional measure development that focuses more specifically on the link between CVD and diabetes. The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is four times greater in people living with type 2 diabetes as compared to those without diabetes.  About 70% of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, making it the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes.  Specifically, we encourage CMS to promote the development and implementation of a diabetes & CVD composite measure that focuses on overlapping treatment processes and goals. Such a measure could focus on aspects of health care such as blood pressure screening and control, lipid screening and control, and tobacco cessation. 

Section III - Part D, Formulary Submissions
CY 2019 Formulary Submission Window

Novo Nordisk supports CMS' decision to delay the summer formulary update window and to add a Medicare Plan Finder update window in the fall and a formulary update window in January of the coverage year. These important update opportunities will allow for improved beneficiary transparency, which will help ensure beneficiaries can make informed enrollment decisions based on the most up-to-date information and that their chosen plan best meets their coverage and affordability needs. 


Sincerely,
 
Tricia Brooks
Vice President, Public Affairs
Novo Nordisk Inc.

"85","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"I find the wording of the proposed regulations quite concerning. They appear to take away the ability of a doctor to treat his/her patient and give control to the insurance companies. They appear to be based on one report from the CDC that is contradicted by another report from the same agency (report is attached).  All these new regulations will do is force chronic pain sufferers to go to other sources to find relief. It may also increase suicide rates and increase other health problems not to mention increasing ER visits.

I'm not currently taking any opiodes but do take gabapentin. In the future I may need to take both. That combination appears to be red flag. I don't take meds for pain, but for other conditions that appear to be ignored by the proposed regulations.  I know enough chronic pain patients that are quite concerned.

Medicine should be practiced by licensed doctors with a personal connection to a patient and not by insurance companies and politicians.

"87","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"CMS unlawfully proposes to interfere with patients whose doctors treat us for pain, by compelling doctors not to exceed an arbitrary dosage limit, that was arbitrarily and capriciously set by a lobbying group called PROP, who lobbied the Centers for Disease Control to allow PROP to publish a rationale for the arbitrary dosage limit on CDC stationery. CMS must halt this unlawful action or I and other consumers will litigate.

The Medicare Act prohibits Medicare from interfering in how treatment is prescribed or performed.  Medicare may reimburse treatments or refuse to reimburse treatments.  It may not order treatments to be withheld.

The proposed Part D Payment Policies go far beyond that legal authority, allowing an insurer to command a pharmacy not to fill a prescription, if the insurer believes the prescription will exceed the arbitrary PROP standard.  I object to this policy as Count I and will sue to have it overturned if CMS adopts it.

Count II of my lawsuit will consist of the arbitrary and capricious nature of the PROP daily limitation of ""90 milligrams morphine equivalent"" (MMEQ) for pain treatment, on the grounds of it being arbitrary, capricious, and a taking of the Fourth Amendment rights of each person to be secure in his person and effects, without due process of law.  That taking arises, because the PROP standard, which CDC adopted as a Guideline and CMS proposes to turn into a Regulation, makes three demonstrably-false assumptions about human opioid metabolism.  The three false assumptions are that every person's enzymes for metabolizing opioids are identical (they're not), that every person's response to all opioids can be quantified by a scheme PROP proposed for defining the ""equivalency of opioids to morphine"" (the scheme is dangerously flawed), and that the normal human body contains no opioids (30 years of Government research proves that humans manufacture morphine in our red blood cells, a fact of which PROP was actually aware at the time it lied to the public and to CDC).  Imposing PROP's 90 MMEQ standard, in the absence of medical evidence supporting it, is a taking of the right to be secure in one's person and one's effects.

Count III of my lawsuit will not be against CMS, as it will apply to the various corporate co-defendants who financed PROP and advanced the PROP scheme at CDC by gifts of money that facially seem to have served the same purpose as would an unlawful bribe.

Since CMS may be ignorant of the reasoning behind Count II of my planned lawsuit, I'm attaching a recent research paper I sent the Food and Drug Administration, reminding them of what 30 years of federally-funded research on opioids actually proved.  Please read the paper and learn from it.  I would prefer if we did not have to litigate.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0471","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","MI"

"146","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"It really doesn't seem to matter to anyone involved in Making the decision to make it so people can only get what is equivalent to 100 mg of morphine which is basically 100 mg of Vicodin. I think about the people involved governors, doctors, lawyers, pharmacists &  some insurance companies and pharmacies, and I think to myself all of these people involved have the means to get whatever dosing they need or want because they have the money and the pull!
 So why would it matter to them that we suffer? They don't have to suffer because they have access to it at any given time!
  I can't sit here and tell you that I have been dealing with this chronic pain for over 20 years but it doesn't matter! I could tell you that I have no fluid in five of my desk in my lower back, I have a 33 curve of scoliosis in my upper back, I have nerve root exposure on both left and right in that area, spinal stenosis,  did generative disc disease that is not slowing down because it is hereditary, as well as I have lost all my reproductive organs at the age of 34. That was 20 years ago! That Dr had no consent to do what he did!  I sued him and he died a year to the day that I served him with the lawsuit .  I lost my case but I'm still alive! In losing all of my reproductive organs it has inadvertently affected my hormones immensely to the point that I have osteoporosis at a very young age !  Not only am I dealing with this pain 24 seven but it is now affecting my brain. It is leaving lesions on my brain because my body is having a very hard time fighting back and it's beginning to shut down part of my body, it's killing my brain cells!  This also doesn't matter to my doctor  that treats my pain!  My doctor tried to give me just 10 mg of Oxsee cotton and my insurance company refused to fill it because they wanted him to give me something stronger to make sure my pain was being taken care of!  I've gone from 100 mg of oxycodone daily with a 50 g Fenton all patch every 72 hours to 60 mg of oxycodone a day!  When my neurologist took a look at my MRIs he actually thought I was in a severe accident and when he found out I wasn't he felt so bad for me!  He told me I was too young to have this many problems with my back and there was no surgery that could help me in this I already knew because I have researched everything!  I was granted access to laser spine Institute and my insurance was going to cover it but the pain doctor that I see pulled the control card! He told me if I went and had the surgery done and I was still in pain he would not be able to see me anymore as a doctor!  I would have to fly to Florida and have it done there and stay for five days to be monitored and then come back home and he refused to see me after that!  One other thing that this pain doctor could do is put in that I have a 25% cross tolerance and he'd be able to increase my pain medicine by doing that but he refused.  Chronic pain patients are not the problem here! We are the ones that are following the guidelines prior to being stripped of our dosing! I have never been overmedicated buy any doctor that I have seen for this and I stay with the same doctor and the same pharmacy  but yet no matter how honest I am I have to deal with the outcome of these crappy laws that hurt me  but no one cares! They don't need to care because they can get their drugs like I said at anytime! They can make all the laws and restrictions and it doesn't make them lose sleep because if they need pain medicine they'll get it! And NO, you don't  take an aspirin and deal with the pain!  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the pharmaceutical companies are going to start selling to the patients themselves because they are losing billions of dollars due to this law !  I am betting you sooner than later they're going to find a way to do that!  There's a loophole to everything isn't there?

"154","CMS",FALSE,4,NA,NA,"The proposed changes to Part D regarding opioid prescribing is not only discriminatory on the chronically ill, chronic pain patients and the disabled community due to its undue burdens placed upon them to receive adequate access to the medically necessary pain management medications including opioid analgesics and Gabapentin. These individuals often lack the financial ability to pay for their doctors appointments therefore it is unreasonable both financially to expect individuals suffering from painful illnesses and/or conditions to be able to go to the doctor once a week. Further our physician offices and hospitals do not have the capacity to take on such a large increase in patient load. In addition, the hard and soft edits intended for Medicare and Medicaid recipients are based on policy and not patient-centered; evidence-based medical care that ensures the best approach to treatment is provided to each patient on an individualized basis which can only be determined by our qualified medical doctors. In addition, there is no scientific study nor clinical trial substantiating the CDC Guidelines of 90 Milligram Morphine Equivalents as recommended and being taken up as policy at CMS for FY19. The aging of our population, increased chronic illness, disease and disabilities within the community are all factors into why it is vital our doctors maintain their ability to prescribe as they see appropriate for their patients. The outlined proposal for 2019 is an unworkable plan with undue burdens placed on the disabled, the physicians, regulatory boards and hospitals and further it insights discrimination in our medical care against those among us whom are the weakest. In addition, as a chronic illness patient suffering a debilitating medical condition I find it abhorrent that such policies would be considered given the clear obstacles for any individuals suffering from an illness or painful condition to be able to adhere to so many appointments both financially and physically. In addition, it exposes many ill patients to environmental factors that could be further detrimental to their health and well being. Finally, I advised you to kindly refer to FDA Docket # FDA-2017-P-5396-0001 in which a Citizens Petition is requesting to remove high dose opioid analgesics from the market and is currently under review due to extension review being required. Given this I feel we need to also put this measure on hold and allow for further public comment and impact studies on current measures taken to combat the opioid epidemic before implementing hard line policies that will impact the sickest, poorest American citizens. We must protect the chronic illness, chronic pain and disabled community while we work to protect those suffering from substance use disorder Finally, please find enclosed 128 letters our Organization, Chronic Illness Advocacy & Awareness Group, collected on behalf of our members, my personal letter and my mother's letter for your consideration when making such decision. These are the stories of real individuals these decisions will directly impact through these proposed changes for 2019. We urge you to remove these undue burdens on medication access to ensure the safety of the American public.

"163","CMS",FALSE,7,NA,NA,"I've been on Opioid meds for 26 years.  I worked full time, was a single parent and also volunteered EMT in my community.  I was forced to give them both up when my condition worsened.  I am now on disability.  I've been denied pain medicine, asked to leave a practice because I needed surgery, had my BEST dr arrested to set an example to the other dr's and even had to develop a spreadsheet to find a new pain dr because no one would take on a patient who could only be medically managed

A lot of the statistics being used have been falsified in order to make things look worse than they really are.  The panels and groups put together did not include Chronic Pain Patients, Pharmacists, Pain Mgmt Dr's, Veterans or anyone who is DIRECTLY connected to ongoing life changing chronic pain.  Unless you experience it you cannot understand it.  Put rocks in your shoes, walk a lot, live in them.  Tape a tennis ball to your lower back, your neck and your mid back.  Leave them and the rocks in place for three days thus putting yourself in constant pain and unable to sleep properly.  See how well you function due to the pain.  I think you will become more understanding.  

You need to call it what it is, the 'illegal Opioid epidemic' thus separating the two TOTALLY different groups.  The ones who take Opioids as prescribed, pass their random pee tests, see their Dr's on a regular basis vs the ones who fail their pee tests, don't see their Dr and are obviously abusing the system and need to be arrested.  The REAL epidemic is with Heroin (which does not have a tie in from long term properly prescribed Opioid use), Crack, Cocaine, Spice, Fentanyl and I could go on.  Do not lump us and call us 'addicts' when we are not. 

It has already been shown that taking Opioid medication from us has caused the Heroin arrest rate and the suicide rate to skyrocket, look at Maine.  They ended up amending their policy due to it.  It will continue to do so.  More people will be unable to work leading to disability payments, food stamps, Sec 8 housing, etc...  PLEASE PLEASE think this through to the end result.  Do your research, do not just jump at the easy answer.  Addicts will always be addicts, it used to be PCP, then Cocaine, Crack, huffing, Spice, now Heroin and Fentanyl.  They will ALWAYS find a way.  PLEASE stop punishing us for their mistakes!  

As Chronic Pain Patients we have tried EVERYTHING before we would agree to take Opioid medications with their financial cost, side effects and the stigma.  This is not a decision we would take lightly.  There are numerous diseases out there for which there are no treatment, no way to make things better other than pain medication.  Take it away and we are unable to function, we cannot clean our homes, do our laundry or shopping and some can barely make it from the bed to the bathroom.  That is NO kind of life which is why the suicide rate has increased so dramatically.

The fact that there are Veterans who have served our country, are returning horribly injured and are now being denied pain meds is unconscionable let alone cruel.  There are published articles that back up my statements in the NEJM, The National Pain Report, STAT and even the DEA, FDA and CDC themselves.  We already have tracking methods in place from the Dr's to the patients on down to the pharmacists and pharmacies.  Please THOROUGHLY research everything and include the people who will be impacted before you make any decisions.

No long term studies have been done proving or disproving the addiction theory.  The CDC refused to accept the info given them based on it's being short term.  Before we do anything more we need long term studies done by unbiased ppl.

Sometimes I have to go to 10 pharmacies to get my meds because they are out and they won't fill them until the day I RUN out so it's either shop around or do w/out.  What do ppl who don't have cars do?  Then some pharmacists prejudge you and refuse a valid script.  The reduction in manuf of Opioids is making it EXTREMELY diff to obtain our needed meds.  PLEASE don't make it more diff for us.  Look back in time, tobacco (#1 killer) was vilified and a lot done to stop it and while it costs us billions yearly and more deaths (inc 2nd hand smoke) than Opioids it's still sold easily.  Alcohol (#2 killer) also causes more deaths and injuries yet there is a TV show about moonshiners!  It is also sold easily.  The prob is the addicts.  We need more rehabs, counselors, etc..  You are punishing all for the sins of a few.  You just CANNOT understand what it's like living in pain ALL the time, barely able to function, only to have it taken away or forcibly reduced to the point you don't want to live.  ALL the decisions are being made by ppl affected by addiction somehow, that is not right.  Where is the fairness?  PLEASE PLEASE don't make any more chgs until some studies have been done.

I will be happy to speak with anyone.

Thank you for your time.

My PM doctor who I finally found reduced my pain meds by 2/3rds in January. Luckily I found him? I went through withdrawals on my own. My tramadol I had taken since 1999 was stopped. It helped me with my burning pain. I have nothing now.

I OPPOSE this 2019 draft call letter
DO NOT ADOPT IT.


The past two decades have witnessed increases in
opioid-related morbidity and mortality concomitant with
increases in the prescribing of opioids to treat chronic
pain. State policy-makers, under pressure to do
something about the overdose rate, have intervened.
One such intervention involves the adoption of daily
opioid thresholds in state prescribing policies that,
once reached, will trigger specific actions or recommendations.
Although dosage threshold models continue
to spread across the United States, these
governmental interventions could have serious unintended
outcomes in terms of increased pain and
opioid-related injury and mortality. The following commentary
highlights the evolution of dosage thresholds,
their potential for unintended outcomes, and advocates
for the evaluation of these models and the
adoption of mandatory education-based alternatives,
alternatives that would provide a balanced approach
to the treatment of pain and the prevention of harm
without interfering with the physician-patient
relationship.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0727","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-WA"

KCP is an alliance of members of the kidney care community that serves as a forum for patient advocates, dialysis care professionals, providers, and manufacturers to advance policies that support the provision of high quality care for individuals with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).  

KCP strongly supports providing beneficiaries living with kidney failure with the ability to select the type of health insurance they believe will best meet their needs. We are pleased that all ESRD patients will have access to MA plans, which will promote coordinated care that may result in better management of kidney failure and related diseases and disorders.  It is important to ensure access to MA plans by providing them with full funding.  As described in detail below, KCP supports the dialysis-only ESRD USPCC growth percentage for CY 2019, the ESRD Normalization Factor trend, and the proposed CKD coefficient.  We are concerned, however, with the lack of guidance around calcimimetics, the recalibration of the ESRD risk adjusters, and the payment year blend of Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS) to Encounter Data System (EDS).

	Enhancing the OMS by such that it identifies high risk beneficiaries who use ""potentiator"" drugs (such as gabapentin and pregabalin) in combination with prescription opioids to ensure that plans provide appropriate case management. Potentiators are drugs that when taken with an opioid increase the risk of an adverse event.

OMS already flags concurrent benzodiazepine use by plan enrollees. 

This is concerning as the gabapentinoid class of medications are extremely useful for pain management, including pain other than neuropathic with not nearly as much concern in combination with opioids as benzos/z drugs/soma. This is a cornerstone medication that has allowed many providers to reduce opioid use and has sufficient evidence to support its continued use. I would remove the concern for these medications at this time, as there are not very many options for alternatives to opioids for pain management, but rather add soma and z drugs to the list of concerns with opioid medications and the already listed benzodiazepines.


	Implementing technical revisions to the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) measures used by CMS to evaluate Part D sponsors' progress in combatting the opioid crisis, and consideration of a new PQA measure, Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines. Given the danger of combining opioids and benzodiazepines, we seek feedback in the Call Letter on starting to track a new measure to address this issue. This measure assesses the percentage of individuals 18 years and older with concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines.

Again, I would add soma and z drugs to this list; this has also been outlined in the CDC guidelines as medications of concern when used in combination with opioids.


	Expecting all sponsors to implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME), with a 7-day supply allowance.

Is this for acute pain or chronic pain or both? If for chronic pain-the 7 day supply, this is not feasible. If for acute pain-these are reasonable measures, however would take into consideration patients with acute on chronic pain that may end up on >90MED more than their baseline due to a new injury/surgery/trauma/etc.


	Implementing a supply limit for initial fills of prescription opioids (e.g., 7 days) for the treatment of acute pain with or without a daily dose maximum (e.g., 50 MME).

Avoid using a daily dose maximum, however the 7 day supply is in alignment with many guidelines and with the direction of new upcoming guidelines.


	Expecting all sponsors to implement soft POS safety edits (which can be overridden by a pharmacist) based on duplicative therapy of multiple long-acting opioids, and request feedback on concurrent prescription opioid and benzodiazepine soft edits.

Add soma and z drugs to the list. Also consider adding multiple short acting opioid medications to this list.

"248","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"To Whom it May Concern: 

Please accept this letter on behalf of the members of the Pennsylvania Pain Society and as comment on CMS-2017-0163's 2018 Draft Call Letter titled Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls (Opioids).
 
The Pennsylvania Pain Society (PPS) was established in 2016 to serve the thousands of physicians and medical professionals who care for the Pennsylvanians who suffer from acute and chronic pain. We represent advanced trained pain specialists and anesthesiologists, neurologists, family medicine, primary care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and elder care physicians and practitioners with a professional interest in acute and chronic pain.   We are an independent, not-for-profit association whose mission encompasses education, advocacy and leadership on issues relating to the multi-modal, individualized treatment of acute and chronic pain.

The Pennsylvania Pain Society wishes to officially voice our opposition to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to place new limits on pharmacies' ability to fill opioid prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed new limits call for ""hard formulary levels""that restrict the amount of opioids Medicare beneficiaries may receive under Part D.  These include a 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) daily limit and 7- day supply allowance, as well as limits on prescriptions for acute pain syndromes such as post-operative pain, traumatic injuries, etc.  While these limits reflect the CDC Guidelines on Opioid Prescribing (March 2016), this proposal fails to take into account the very nature of the Medicare Part D targeted patient population, i.e., individuals who are over age 65 and/or disabled. Furthermore, it ignores the explicit CDC caveat that individuals with serious, life-threatening illness and those with chronic pain at the end of life should be exempt from the CDC's aforementioned restrictions on prescribed opioids. Medicare enrollees are, in fact, the group most likely to suffer from serious illness: they have multiple comorbid conditions, many of which cause persistent pain, and they are clearly those most likely to be facing end-of-life health scenarios. 

In short, these proposed restrictions make no sense in the Medicare population. PPS shares CMS' concerns over injudicious or over- prescribing of opioid medications and its effect on the current and well-publicized overdose epidemic. We strongly support and endorse ongoing efforts to address this public health crisis. However, as current data indicate, opioid prescribing rates have exhibited a steady decline since 2010. Overdose death rates from legally prescribed opioids have likewise dropped, unfortunately with a consequential increase in the number of deaths related to illegal opioids such as heroin, carfentanil and sufentanil.  Limiting access to appropriately prescribed and monitored opioid analgesia for older and disabled Americans is not likely to eliminate the underlying problem of Substance Use Disorder or diminish opioid overdose deaths.   Rather, this proposal makes it much more likely that effective analgesia will be denied to those who truly need it.  

One of the primary duties of all Physicians and Practitioners is to relieve pain and suffering.  These proposed restrictions pose a direct threat to not only our ability to fulfill that responsibility but also to the care of all pain patients.  The Members of the Pennsylvania Pain Society strongly urge CMS to critically re-examine the specifics of this proposal and, at the very least, include an exemption for Medicare enrollees who suffer from serious illnesses and life-limiting conditions which are associated with severe and/or chronic pain.  This pain can be ameliorated with appropriate, accessible pain management strategies which must include the potential use of opioid preparations.

"264","CMS",FALSE,2,NA,NA,"I am a general internist-researcher studying chronic pain. I agree with the plan to reduce use of opioids but I believe this has to be done by the physician in collaboration with the patient, gradually. 90 days is a short time to change management for patients who have been treated for years. It can be done safely and it is being done. 

CMS should be paying for effective, non-drug options such as chronic pain self management training and support instead of making short-sighted regulations about opioids. Our group has been studying what patients with chronic pain want  - such as support for safe exercise training, stretching, nutrition (yes weight has alot to do with it), massage.  Medicaid and Medicare do not financially support the services that patients need to improve how they live with chronic pain. Do not make regulations without understanding the entire spectrum of pain care. 

Lastly our research has found in a representative sample of Hispanics in five states that the public has limited understanding of chronic pain. We should be doing more primary prevention - spend our money on education and support for the public to understand the limited role of opioids and the complexity of managing chronic pain.

Established in 2003, Commonwealth Care Alliance (CCA) is a community-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization dedicated to improving care for people with complex chronic conditions, including multiple disabilities. For individuals who are dually eligible for MassHealth, the Medicaid program in Massachusetts, and Medicare, our unique, nationally recognized health plans provide and coordinate the full spectrum of care - medical, behavioral health, dental, durable medical equipment and social services - to eliminate gaps in care and reduce costs. Disability-competent direct primary care is provided by our wholly owned clinical affiliate, Commonwealth Community Care, an organization with more than 30 years of experience supporting adults with complex physical, developmental, intellectual and mental health disabilities, as well as through over 27,000 providers in our contracted provider network.

CCA serves more than 25,000 beneficiaries statewide in Massachusetts through our dual eligible special needs plan (D-SNP) and our Medicare-Medicaid Financial Alignment Initiative plan.  Our D-SNP plan provides services to over 9,000 beneficiaries, the vast majority of whom are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid age 65 and above.  We have consistently achieved four stars or above in the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings program, including achieving five stars on 18 measures and four stars on another 12 measures for 2018.

CCA supports a number of provisions in this proposed rule that would promote greater alignment of medical and non-medical coverage and encourage enrollment in aligned plans.  We believe these proposed changes will help special needs plans and MMPs achieve better coordination of medical and non-medical services and supports.

"297","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Anticoagulant medications (including non-warfarin oral anticoagulant, or NWOAs) are used by hundreds of thousands of people in the US and, due to the lack of prescribing and care management standards, are major contributors to  serious and avoidable adverse drug events, particularly among seniors. Also, under-utilization of anticoagulants and non-adherence are major contributors to catastrophic strokes, DVT, and pulmonary emboli. Despite their wide (and growing) utilization, their remarkable efficacy, and the risk of avoidable adverse events when not properly managed, there are NO national standards for prescribing and managing these drugs. Systems have been developed to assure safe management of lesser-used medications that have known serious side-effects (e.g. REMS) but, amazingly, no such standards exist for anticoagulant utilization.

The Pharmacy Quality Alliance has developed a robust, claims-based measure of adherence to NWOAs, but CMS has concluded that such a measure is not worthy of implementation for Medicare Managed Care and Part D plans for 2019. Given the volume of prescribing, the profound efficacy in common conditions (e.g. AF), and the devastating harm caused by mismanagement and poor adherence, the decision by CMS is perplexing, to say the very least.

In my attached letter I share my personal experience with the agents (including the premature death of my own father) and describe multiple reasons supporting the inclusion of the NWOA measure for 2019 Safety Reports. 

I urge you to reconsider your decision regarding the NWOAs, and hope that you will include the PQA measure for 2019. It is an important first step in driving national improvements in the outpatient management of this high-risk class of medications, and to delay is to perpetuate the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the current, low-quality care system.

"319","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"This is a second comment to the docket,  following on and expanding my input of a few days ago on behalf of the Alliance for the Treatment of Intractable Pain and millions of chronic and intractable pain patients who will be deeply harmed by the proposed CMS regulation changes.  

I challenge HHS/CMS to read and embrace the attached article, about to hit news stands across the US, written by Jacob Sullum, Senior Editor of *Reason Magazine*.  ""America's War on Pain Pills Is Killing Addicts and Leaving Patients in Agony""

This article demonstrates beyond any reasonable contradiction that America's opioid ""crisis"" is almost entirely unrelated to medically managed prescription of opioid analgesics by doctors to pain patients. This work and the references quoted in it utterly discredit the dominant official narrative concerning the sources of addiction in America.  

The draconian and unsupported regulations which CMS seeks to impose in mandatory safety audits and limitation of opioid dosing will reliably damage many more than the 1.6 million patients now estimated to be prescribed more than 90 MMED.  The regulations will also damage and kill many more people with addiction, as well. 

Two other sources should also enter the official record in opposition to the proposed CMS changes.  

Dr Sally Satel, an addiction psychiatrist, has published ""The Myth of What's Driving the Opioid Crisis (Doctor-prescribed painkillers are not the biggest threat).""  See https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/21/the-myth-of-the-roots-of-the-opioid-crisis-217034 .  Her points parallel and reinforce those of Jacob Sullum.

Finally, I have also published recently in these issues, with Stephen Schatman,MD,  ""Do Alternatives to Opioids Really Exist?""  See https://morningconsult.com/opinions/do-alternatives-to-opioids-really-exist/ .  With Dr Schatman, I point out that the quality of medical literature for non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical alternatives in treatment of chronic pain is so abysmal that we really do not know whether such alternatives provide any benefit beyond placebo effect.  We also address the failure of medical demographics to support the silly notion that over-prescribing to pain patients could have caused the explosion of addicts now so near and dear to politician hearts.  

Thus pain patients offer CMS this message:  CEASE HALT AND DESIST!  Retract your proposal and relinquish the outright STUPID notion that restriction of opioid therapy to pain patients can impact the drug crisis at all.  It cannot.  All that you will succeed in doing is harming more people than the CDC opioid prescription guidelines already have.

"347","CMS",FALSE,6,NA,NA,"Hi!

I guess I should put a label on myself.
I am a Disabled Crime Victim. I am also speaking on behalf of family members who are Cancer Patients, Elderly Citizens - 90 and 96, and Degenerative Bone-Loss Sufferers.

These people are so bed-bound that they can't come on here and comment to stick up for themselves while other people make decisions for them by proxy.

I am AGAINST this PROPOSAL - Count me as a NO VOTE and here is why:

Ok... so, Cap Rates - If the the result you are looking for is all of the disabled people listed above, commiting suicide, having heart attacks, seeking medicine on the black market, being bed bound from lack of mobility, loss of family and loving relationships, burdoning the family members of those disabled people, sedintary lifestyles, early death, tortured end of life, and of course PAIN, etc then Capitation Rates will certainly do that.
CMS has been informed many times about the increase in quality of life, family engagement, mobility, travel, happiness, overall health, and of course PAIN, etc.

We, disabled people, are not making these Prescription level choices by ourselves. We are being monitored closely and giving detailed reports every month as to our conditions to 2 doctors because we are required by law to have a specialist. 
We are required to be under close scrutiny.
We are required to give monthly Urine Tests, the same way people on probation and parole are treated with skepticism.
We follow all of the extra rules closely like, not being allowed to change pharmacies and find a better price or looking for a different care provider for better or different treatment or a second opinion.
We don't complain or rock the boat for fear of being abandoned as a patient.
We are treated with Distrust and Suspicion no matter our age or criminal history or lack there of.
We are constantly under attack with new proposed regulations on Regulations.Gov, being criticized for taking a medication that works very well for us, all because there are bad people in the world that like to huff paint, sniff glue, and abuse drugs.
WE ARE NOT CRIMINALS and yet.... WE ARE TREATED AS SUCH.

NOW.... someone wants to get personally involved in the decision and recommendations of our doctors. Someone who is most likely NOT licensed in our State to Practice medicine. Knowing all of the various class-action lawsuits on Pharmaceutical Drug makers in US. Courts throughout time, you are actually considering a ONE-SIZE FITS ALL plan for many people with many different conditions.
As Court Cases and Medical Evidence has shown, this is a Horrible Idea!
Many people have different tolerances for pain. There is medical evidence that some people have a low threshold for pain and a High tolerance for Opioids, GENETICALLY.

Cap Rates continued -  If the result you are looking for is the end of the Opioid Epidemic, this is NOT a solution. This will have literally NO effect on Opioid Drug abuse.  The Production of Prescription Opioids and the U.S. Supply has steadily declined by mandate of the DEA, as you are well aware, for the last 10 yrs yet Opioid Overdoses has risen. (Refer to Graph included).
Why is that? Because your problem is NOT Prescription Opioids. You problem is Illicit Opioids such as Heroin and Illicit Fentanyl (NOT Prescription Fentanyl). The DEA themselves say that leas than 2% of Prescriptions make their way to the black market.(Excerpt included)

To wrap this up, I will just list some of the injuries I have sustained that require me to have MORE THAN a 90 mme per day opioid based medicone treatment:
Head injury, Brain Injury, 1 month Coma, Broken Neck (C7), Crushed Torso/Thoracic - 9 Ribs right front//6 Ribs left front//5 Ribs right back, Broken Collar Bone left, 3 Broken Wrist Bones right (3screws), 4 Broken Wrist Bones left (3screws), Broken Knee Cap left, Partically Cracked Sternum center, Cracked Cranium right side, Shattered Arm upper right (Rod and 4 screws), Detatached and Lesion/Lacerations forearm near elbow (skin graphs, large gaping hole 2screws), Lung Collapsed right Contusions/Lacerarions, Rotary Cuff Left, Rotary Cuff right (arms spun around backwards and dislocated), Foot ""Taco'd"" Broken  in half (Carpels) right, Broken Ankle right.
Proven in court federal, I have permanent injuries, won litigation, granted permanent full long term disability.

Note:
If you are serious, you should probably talk to the DEA for not locking up the people who brought these drugs in to our country in the first place. Their budget was $2.1 Billion in 2017 and have an Efficiency rate of less than 1% at Intercepting the flow of Drugs. Doctors and 90 yr old Grandmas are not the source of the Opioid Epidemic.

Maybe one should look at the largest exporter of Heroin in the world, which I will not name here. I mean...if you're actually serious about ending the illegal opioid trade and its effects on American children and adults, that is....

"362","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Before implementing the proposed limitations on prescription pain medication, you need to evaluate the unintended consequences this will bring for chronic pain patients. No, we are not being treated the same since the CDC guidelines were released. Our care has been hampered, we're treated like a scourge on society, and we are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to receive the care we so desperately need and deserve. Patients are dying, and many more are suffering inhumane levels of pain because physicians fear prosecution by the DEA for doing nothing more than treating their patients.

Let's examine the recent studies and facts associated. I urge you to review these, as they are vastly different than the facts and figures being touted by the mainstream media and even some policymakers:

#1. ""Less than 4 percent of people who had misused prescription pain medicines started using heroin within 5 years""
Source: https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin

#2. Long gone is the notion that 80% of heroin users start with pain medication. ""Heroin as an initiating opioid now exceeds hydrocodone and oxycodone.""
Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460317302083

#3. Current post-operative pain management carries a risk of addiction of 0.6% (less than one percent)
Source: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180117185105.htm

#4. In counties where coroners have identified the specific drug that caused overdoses, they have found that prescription pain medications are rarely the cause of death
Source 4a: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6634a3.htm (Montgomery County, OH)
Source 4b: https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/11/19/fentanyl-heroin-changing-us-opioid-epidemic (Jefferson County, AL)

The bottom line is this: If someone is going to abuse drugs, they will rarely go to a doctor to do it.  They are going to the streets, purchasing illicit substances. Addicts are not going to be impacted one iota by more restrictions on prescription pain medication.  It isn't helping them, nor is it harming them.  The only people being impacted by these restrictions are the millions of chronic pain patients who are being harmed by these restrictions. Are some patients abusing medications? Yes, but studies show that it is less than one percent. Why punish more than 99% of us for the actions of less than 1%?

Restrictions on pain medications are doing absolutely nothing to help the opiate epidemic.  Quite the opposite, in fact. Patients who lose access to the one treatment that help them are turning to the streets, buying illicit medication in an attempt to end their suffering.  If you review the statistics attached (source: ATIP), you will see that a decrease in pain prescriptions occurs at the same time that overdoses skyrocket. Why would you want to continue this trend????

Please, stop the discrimination against pain patients. We have done absolutely nothing wrong. If there is one thing I can stress, it's that doctors are refusing to treat us because they are afraid of being unjustly prosecuted by the DEA. CMS implementing further restrictions on pain medication will do nothing to help addiction and only further the inhumane suffering of pain patients.

I will be eligible for Medicare due to disability later this year.  I am also an intractible pain patient; my pain is 24/7, 365 days a year due to adhesive arachnoiditis (AA).  The pain produced by adhesive arachnoiditis has been compared to that of end stage cancer, but without the escape of death. PLEASE, think about that for a moment.  What would you do if you had the pain of end stage bone cancer, and knew you would have to live with that pain for the next 30-40 years. Unable to leave home, rarely leaving your bed. Please, tell me what lengths you would go to relieve that pain? Now, what if you found something that let you function again, go to see your children perform, go to the grocery store, and even take a vacation for the first time in years.  Would you be upset if the government were trying to take that away? You bet you would!  And so am I extremely frustrated by the lack of concern for the chronic pain community when these regulations are proposed. 

Untreated and under-treated pain can, and do, kill.  By limiting the amount of pain medication a doctor can prescribe, will you be able to sleep at night knowing that thousands of pain patients are committing suicide, going into adrenal crisis, or having heart attacks because of their pain?  Will you be able to sleep knowing that millions of post-op patients will need to make unnecessary trips back to their surgeon for another prescription because the government wouldn't allow them more than a 7 day supply for their pain?  These proposals are absolutely preposterous! 

Please, stop this madness.  Allow our trained, highly qualified pain management physicians to be in charge of our care.  Our lives quite literally depend on it.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0757","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","Amy Partridge-PA"

"371","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the 2019 Advance Notice and Call Letter for Medicare Advantage and Part D. Please see our full comment letter posted to this website.

ACHP is a national leadership organization bringing together health plans and provider organizations that are among America's best at delivering affordable, high-quality coverage and care.  Members are non-profit plans active in 30 states and the District of Columbia, providing both private and public coverage to more than 19 million Americans, including 2.3 million Medicare beneficiaries. 

We greatly appreciate CMS' commitment to providing regulatory flexibility and relief from outdated or burdensome requirements in this Advance Notice and Call Letter and in the previously proposed rule for MA and Part D. Proposals in both documents reflect recommendations that ACHP has previously offered and will facilitate the ability of plan sponsors to strengthen benefits that reflect the needs of their enrollees and administer coverage efficiently.

The following summary highlights ACHP's response to several issues in the 2019 Advance Notice and Call Letter:

	Restoring Quality Payments: ACHP urges CMS to pay full quality bonuses created by Congress to ensure seniors receive the highest possible quality of care. We continue to believe that the statute allows the Secretary discretion to exclude the quality payments from the benchmark cap calculation, as is done in other Medicare programs.

	Improving Accuracy of the Benchmark Calculation:  While the issue is not directly addressed in the Advance Notice, ACHP urges CMS to revise its calculation of FFS costs. Part A-only FFS beneficiaries have very different utilization and cost patterns from those who enroll in both A and B - and they are a growing segment of the FFS population.  The result is that county MA benchmarks, driven by FFS costs, are lower than they would be if the appropriate comparison group were used - i.e., A/B enrollees.  

	Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls for Opioid Overuse/Misuse: We applaud CMS' commitment to using its authority to address the nationwide opioid epidemic. We strongly support the proposal to incorporate a 7-day limit on opioid prescriptions for first-time opioid users. We recommend  that cumulative daily dosage edits at the point of sale would be more effective if plan sponsors are permitted to require that specific criteria are met before a hard edit may be overridden, beyond simply having the provider attest to the prescription's medical necessity.   

	Health-Related Supplemental Benefits: ACHP supports the additional flexibility proposed in allowing health-related services to be covered as supplemental benefits. The expanded definition of supplemental benefits  strengthens the ability of health plans to address the home environment and other factors affecting health status and provide care tailored to individual needs.

	Star Ratings: We appreciate CMS' commitment to quality improvement and the star ratings and welcome the plan to establish a Technical Expert Panel for future consultation on the ratings. We urge CMS to discontinue use of the improvement measures which distort the star ratings and are unnecessary given that the entire purpose of the ratings is to incentivize improvement. 

	Proposed Part C Risk Adjustment Model:  ACHP appreciates development of the Payment Condition Count CMS-HCC model but recommends delay until 2020, in order for CMS and plan sponsors to analyze its potential effects and adjust to the revised HCC model. 

	Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs):  ACHP recommends that CMS continue to phase-in use of the individual bid-to-benchmark ratio to calculate the Part C base payment for EGWPs for the 2019 MA EGWP payment rates. Given the magnitude of the change, we recommend retaining the 50/50 blend of individual and EGWP bids for 2019.  

	Coding Intensity Adjustment:  ACHP is pleased that CMS will not increase the coding intensity adjustment beyond the statutory minimum of -5.91 percent.  We recommend that future adjustments differentiate among plans according to coding patterns as MedPAC has proposed.  

	Normalization Factor:  ACHP encourages CMS to calibrate the Part C risk adjustment models with 2015 diagnoses and 2016 costs so that the FFS normalization factor is 1.000 for the year 2016 rather than 1.000 for 2015, resulting in a more accurate forecast of the normalization factor.

 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services

RE:	Docket number: CMS-2017-0163
 
Dear Mr. Kouzoukas,

I write to you on behalf of the P.R. College of Physicians and Surgeon (the ""CMCPR""), a compulsory association encompassing the totality of the licensed physicians in Puerto Rico. We subscribe the comments submitted by the Medicare and Medicaid Advantage Products Association of Puerto Rico (""MMAPA"") to the 2019 Medicare Advantage and Part D Advance Notice Part II and Draft Call Letter. However, on behalf of the approximately 9,000 physicians licensed in Puerto Rico, the CMCPR submits that CMS must approve regulation to ensure that the rate increases based on the higher cost of living and of providing services is passed on to the providers who actually incur in those higher costs, and is NOT kept by the health insurance company as is currently happening.

CMS has acknowledged that a far greater proportion of Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico receive benefits through Medicare Advantage than in any state or territory. The high concentration of these patients in the handful of Medical Advantage insurers in Puerto Rico has led to a concentration of market power to the ultimate detriment of the patients. This market power has been used by such insurers and their affiliates to force providers to accept such conditions such as unreasonably low payment rates and the contracting of TPAs who impose unreasonable conditions, the termination without cause or one-sided modification of provider contracts, in order not to be forced out of the market. This practice has led to a massive exodus of physicians from the Island, causing a shortage in specialists and a long waiting period for patients to see these doctors. It has also led to the concentration of patients in fewer physicians, to the detriment of the healthcare the patients receive. Additionally, it has also caused patients to leave to seek treatment, splitting families apart. 
 
History has shown that increasing rates to Medicare Advantage insurers in Puerto Rico based on higher costs of providing the services is no guarantee that such increase will be passed on to the party who actually bears the cost. As CMCPR has consistently denounced, the recent increase based on a revised GPCI for Puerto Rico did not result in an increase in rates paid to providers; to the contrary, Medicare Advantage insurers kept the increase for themselves. CMS must make sure for the ultimate benefit of the Medicare Advantage patients that increases based on higher cost of living or of providing services is passed on to the provider who bears the increase in cost and is not kept by the insurer to increase profits for its shareholders.

We trust that CMS will take our comments into consideration and that it will act accordingly to protect its patients in Puerto Rico.

Attentively,

"473","CMS",FALSE,3,NA,NA,"

I am a 38 year old mother of two, and I was a PTA for 7 years, and an RN student, an artist, a writer, an author, a traveler, a child care provider, a server, a manager, a human resources administrative assistant, a home business owner, a swimmer, a hiker, a journalist, an editor, a painter, a sculptor, a blogger, a volunteer for mobile spay/neuter clinics, a home health aide, a youth group leader, a church bus driver, a MOTHER, an online tutor in English, a patient advocate, a bus monitor, a cashier, a hostess, a dancer, a singer, a poet, and I wore many, many other hats. 
This was all before being hit by a drunk driver and enduring a six-hour brain surgery and a 7 hour back surgery.  I am now unable to do 98% of the things I used to do, love, and enjoy.  The CDC/lawmakers took my quality of life.  Now remove the words ""quality of"".  The CDC/lawmakers took my life.
   I stayed at UK hospital in Lexington KY for 115 (one hundred fifteen) days.  I was prescribed pain control medication to care for my pain.  I now have failed back surgery syndrome, fibromyalgia, compression fractures in the spine, narrowing spinal cord, metallic fragments in the neck and brain from neurosurgery, and a host of other painful conditions.  I was cut completely from my medicine, without warning, and suffered for 28 days straight, with seizures (which I never had before this crime) and withdrawal from stopping medications abruptly, which by the grace of God, did not kill me.  I had three seizures during this time, and I have never been epileptic and have never had seizures before or after this. Lyrica 450mg/day to zero.  Oxycodone 80mg/day to zero.  Cymbalta 30mg/day to zero.  
   People are dying in epic proportions due to suicide, and a huge percentage of these people had no mental health issues...they just could not stand the pain and the forced withdrawal or taper, thanks to these guidelines being used as concrete laws.  People are going to use drugs, whether they're legal or not.  The problem still exists.  
And now that these prescribing guidelines are being played with, people are not getting pain care, so many have turned to the street, and have been introduced to the world of illicit fentanyl mixed with so called heroin, and they're also dropping like flies.  Kinda retroactive.  The purpose of the CDC guidelines was to decline addiction rates.  The purpose has failed and has caused the rates to NOT decline, NOT stay the same, but SKYROCKETED in dramatically epidemically numbered proportions.  Harm has been caused, and crime has been placed at the doorstep of already suffering patients.  There is blood on someone's hands.  I would think this would bother you, as it does me.  I stay awake at night and cry over the people who are contemplating ending their lives due to this atrocious situation.  Do not punish people who are already suffering!  What about mandatory rehab, rather than jail?  Why make someone who is already suffering, suffer even more...to the point of death?  Pain care gives back the quality of life that many millions of people would not have if their care was abruptly stopped like mine was.  It's time to put a stop to this.  I can put thousands of faces with thousands of names, if you wish.  Let's just hope they're not obituary pictures by the time you make a change.

Please make it possible for palliative care patients to have the medicine they need for pain, without being treated as a criminal.  Even those without cancer should be treated with pain medication if they have these debilitating diseases, as the neuro-pathways in in the body are all the same, and there is no distinction between Cancer pain and chronic pain. I can and will provide documentation to prove this.

 I have many life shortening and debilitating illnesses which have disabled me...one is adhesive arachnoiditis,  which is listed as one of the top most painful diseases. That's on top of the torn ligaments in my ankles from avulsion fractures and torn ligaments in my shoulder,  all from car accident when I was hit by a drunk driver while my sons were in the car. 

If you tell a Dr you're in pain, you're automatically treated like an addict.  At least legalize marijuana if you aren't going to allow CPPs to have the medicine we need to live somewhat normal lives. This is genocide...people are killing themselves because they can't handle the pain. Some are turning to the streets where they're dying from heroin mixed with illicit fentanyl. How is this ok?

"546","CMS",FALSE,10,NA,NA,"Intractable pain patients, like myself, are among the most vulnerable of our population. But the government is not protecting us and worse, they are causing us harm. The CMS proposed restrictions of opioid dosages will harm many people. Some patients require a higher dose due to genetic malabsorption defects, some due to rare and difficult to treat conditions that cause severe, intense, unrelenting pain. I have Adhesive Arachnoiditis, a debilitating, progressive, inflammatory condition of the spine that causes severe, intractable pain. There may come a time when I require an opioid dosage that exceeds this limit. But if this restriction goes into effect, it is unlikely I will receive the necessary dosage. Instead I will suffer intensely, needlessly, become home and bed bound, and possibly choose to end my life rather than endure such agony. You have no business interfering with my doctor patient relationship and with my ability to receive appropriate medical care! I realize you will object, and say there are exceptions made through the preauthorization process. But that will be a huge deterrent for most physicians. It demands extra time from them, time they don't have and time equals money. They can pay staff to handle the pre-auth process, but that also requires money. This alone will discourage many physicians. Instead they will take the easy route and lower their patient's dosage, even when its not the appropriate medical care and may actually cause patient harm. The only people who will have to live with the outcome of these restrictions are the patients. The patient is left out of this equation. The patient will have no say in the matter, no say in the quality of their own life. And if they attempt to seek another physician to prescribe their needed dose, they face being ""red flagged"" or labeled as a ""drug seeker"". They can be blackballed and entirely abandoned by the medical community. It's already happening to many. We have become hostages and pawns to the ""Opioid Epidemic"".  Also, many physicians will see this as the government setting a standard acceptable opioid dose, therefore prescribing outside this dose could bring unwanted attention on them and their license from the DEA. The DEA is already targeting legitimate physicians, like renowned pain expert, Dr Forrest Tennant. They are creating widespread fear and panic among doctors. This fear has already caused many physicians to stop prescribing pain medications, regardless of what their individual patients need. This ""one size fits all"" medicine never works. Nobody would accept dose restrictions placed on insulin or blood pressure medication. And yet, this is becoming standard practice for treatment of pain. This is unfair and unscientific. It is an attack on chronic pain and intractable pain patients and discrimination. It's inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The CDC data has shown that prescription opioids have plummeted, while deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl continue to skyrocket. There is no Opioid Epidemic. There is only a Heroin and Illicit Fentanyl Epidemic! And now there's a pain refugee epidemic and pain crisis. These measures will only make it worse. The government is still trying to fix the problem by controlling doctors and pharmacists and restricting pain medications, even though that's not the source of the problem. This may be an easier target than drug cartels and illegal drugs from China sent via USPS, but it will not save a single drug addict. On the other hand, it may cause chronic pain patients to commit suicide. I doubt that this is the outcome anyone is hoping for, but all evidence indicates that it will be. The VA recently released statistics that showed veterans forced off opioids have an increased incidence of suicide, not overdose from illegal drugs. The overwhelming data shows that this measure will hurt many, and help few, if any. Pain patients in this country are being victimized and treated like addicts and criminals, and now the CMS wants to join in. Many have already faced forced tapers and elimination of pain medications. They have been demonized by society and abandoned by the medical community, and now our government. Many are suffering complications from under treated and untreated pain, like heart attacks, stroke and adrenal failure. I've suffered adrenal fatigue from under treated pain. It's a very serious health problem. It's hard for me to understand why my government would contribute to causing these complications on elderly and disabled Americans. And sadly, many intractable pain patients are choosing suicide. These proposed changes are irresponsible and cruel. The only positive outcome will be the government will save money. And many believe that is the driving force. But using the heroin and illicit fentanyl epidemic as camouflage to cut costs on vulnerable patients is reprehensible. Please don't do this! Please protect intractable pain patients.

"665","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"On behalf of and all those Medicare beneficiaries who have major medical problems that require ongoing pain management, please do not enact changes for opioid prescribing that could negatively impact their quality of life and ongoing health issues. Undertreated pain in the disabled and elderly populations can affect not only their ability to perform activities of daily living, but can pose grave dangers to their health, including death, from side effects of untreated pain such as increased blood pressure, heart rate and increased cardiac strain.  The potential efficacy of opioid medications in chronic pain management is well established. From Cochrane reviews to policy statements from the Mayo Clinic, there is medical value here. The under-treatment of pain among the elderly is already a problem, and the opioid crisis is impacting cancer pain care and hospice care, too.  Opioid medications are best left as a last option for treatment, after all other methods fail, but are still a very important and timely last option. 
         We strongly object to the government's continued interference in the medical care of intractable pain patients. We believe that patients and their doctors should be making the decisions about their healthcare, not the federal government partnered with insurance companies.
         We strongly oppose the Centers for Medicare adopting the March 2016 Centers for Disease Control Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The proposal that ""all sponsors implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90MME- the dose ceiling recommended by the CDC. This will give pharmacies and insurance carriers the right to over-ride the physicians prescription which is based on the physician's knowledge of individual conditions and medical necessity, not an arbitrary number of MME's, and will result in the pharmacy refusing to fill prescriptions. Not only is this number of MME's arbitrary and unscientific, it excludes those outlier's, who by no fault of their own, have different rates of metabolism of many types of medications. It will cause unneeded suffering and increased pain in a population already struggling with on-going and intractable health conditions.

"718","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Attached the Puerto Rico Healthcare Community Letter signed by 25 public and private entities and key constituents of Puerto Rico's health system, which agree that (1) there is an anomalous historic situation that makes MA rates in Puerto Rico uniquely low; and (2) HHS and CMS should take immediate administrative action to make meaningful adjustments that can mitigate the harmful funding gap for MA in Puerto Rico. 

Multiple community organizations, including the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage Products Association of Puerto Rico (MMAPA), have presented new proposals, evidence, and updated analysis to support a meaningful positive adjustment in the MA rates for Puerto Rico counties in 2019. 

Main Proposals include:

1.	HHS and CMS should use administrative flexibility to meaningfully adjust MA rates in Puerto Rico for CY2019 in the Final Announcement and Call Letter for CY2019, after recognizing new evidence of data anomalies and the harmful effects of the recent natural disaster.

2.	HHS and CMS should establish a proxy methodology for the 2019 MA benchmark or a national floor for the Average Geographic Adjustment (AGA floor) of 0.70 for all counties in MA rate-setting. The latter would move PR counties to an AGA closer to other Caribbean Territories and protect all the counties in the Nation from cases of extremely low AGAs resulting from clear data deficiencies and fluctuations. Implementing an AGA floor now will prevent further erosion and irreparable harm to the healthcare system.  A similar approach should be used to calculate the ESRD benchmark to ensure resources are available to properly care for this vulnerable population. 

3.	CMS can phase-in the impact of the proposed policy for MA benchmarks in a period of 2-3 years, starting in 2019, and monitor closely the effects on the system. MA plans in Puerto Rico are committed to work with CMS in defining additional bid requirements, bid to benchmark ratio parameters or monitoring tools to measure the impact of the adjustment in relation to provider compensation and development of value-based payment models. 

4.	County rates in Puerto Rico are such outliers in 2018 that the level of payment proposed would still leave them at least 15% or more below the average MA rates in the state with the lowest average. The additional funding will provide the necessary inflow to support recovery efforts for our health system while remaining as the lowest cost option in the Nation and will also help address migration of providers and patients, ultimately avoiding unnecessary costs to the Federal government.

5.	Puerto Rico has higher costs of living than the US average. The unsustainably low pricing of health care is partly the result of historic anomalies in Medicare that continue to push compensation down, while accommodating increases in the price of other inputs like prescription drugs. There is precedent in CMS regulation of the use of proxy factors and alternative methods when data elements of a statutory formula are simply not present or deficient. Puerto Rico MA rates after the ACA are a clear case, and a step to break the spiral to the bottom is needed now more than ever. Given the socio-economic scenario, and the recent natural disaster, Puerto Rico MA plans are also increasingly spending additional resources to tackle social determinants of health. Transportation, care coordination, community outreach are efforts that have become harder and costlier, but also more important for MA beneficiaries in PR.

6.	The Puerto Rico Community is appreciative of policy adjustments already taken by the Administration. We support CMS proposal to continue to provide Puerto Rico plans special consideration due to the program inequities in the Star rating measure, in particular the proposed hold harmless methodology due to the impact of the natural disaster.  We also support that the zero claim adjustment implemented in 2017 and 2018 remain until a temporary solution to the data anomalies can be implemented.  Finally, we also support the 2018 decision to assign double bonus status to most counties in the Island and would request CMS to evaluate expanding the policy to cover all 78 municipalities.  However, new evidence studied this past year suggests that these current adjustments are far from enough. The continued deterioration requires a higher-impact policy action to stop the harmful and increasing funding gap. Simultaneously, we continue to work with other persisting anomalies, unique to Puerto Rico in Medicare FFS, such as the use of the SSI indicator and the wage index fix in Part A.

With the fair and needed adjustments we have been proposing, there is no doubt Puerto Rico can continue to make progress towards operating the most cost-effective high quality MA and Part D programs in the Nation.

Less than .01% in the United States are addicted & abuse opioid based drugs according to the NIH study reporting 2,000,000 opioid addicts. These attacks on veterans and Americans with Chronic Pain Disease in excess of 100,000,000 patients constitute 31% of the population with 25,000,000 with severe conditions making up 8% of the total population. 

These attacks against our doctors and our ability to receive legitimate pain medications, not the illegal stuff on the streets coming from Mexico & China, amounts to medical genocide against the weakest among us; the elderly, cancer patients & disabled. No amount of money the sponsors of these lies should interfere with our rights to be able to pursue life liberty & happiness. Otherwise, I am afraid a eugenics program on this level is something Hitler would have been proud to see: the American government targeting citizens and veterans for elimination.

Many of its facilities were shut down for allowing access to drugs, lack of support personnel, and violation of PA, NY, & NJ law.

 I am preparing a paper to submit to Federal Court that shows the review done by the CDC at the order of the Senate Oversight Committee was, in fact, done by the very same people who wrote the Guidelines.

Rather than pencil pushers and number crunchers drafting items like this faster than anyone can realize the effects,

Go into the RV parks and listen to the elderly who have had to sell their homes because they have reached Medicare and Socia
 Security age and the programs are not turning out to be what they were initially designed for.
Stop taking benefits away from those who have worked and paid their dues
Take polls from people who are actually on medicare and medicaid, most of them are completely unaware of what is being done
  and how it affects them  
Go into the forums such as the mayo clinic or any other forum related to chronic pain or those with disabilities - you people are not 
listening and are oblivious to what is happening 
You don't have to be articulate or follow the commenters checklist provided above to have and express an opinion about something
  that is wrong.  This is wrong.
 - you can't tell someone's chronic pain to stop because their is a $cap so you'll have to wait
-you can't force someone to take the generic version of a medicine because it is cheaper, it doesn't work like that.  Have you ever
  heard of genetic testing for medicines pharmacogenics, not everyone has the same reaction to medicine.  For example, my husband
  takes lyrica, Jan 1st due to medicare and insurance changes he could no longer receive lyrica unless he wanted to spend $1000 per month
out of pocket he was forced to use gabapentin until we could find and pay for yet another supplemental insurance that would cover 
 lyrica for him.  Don't speak to me of an ""override nor tell me generic is the same as name brand  because it is NOT if it were the cost would be
the same and there really wouldn't be a need for generic medication.  It's like going to the grocery store and buying cereal, do you want the name
brand cereal in the box or the bag version for $2 less.  Ask your children they will want the namebrand because it's better.  Same principle with medication.  
-stop messing with Medicare and Medicaid unless your going to increase benefits and payments to those who desperately need it
 and have paid for it.
-here is a thought focus your pencil pushing, number crunching ideas towards getting people off welfare who haven't worked a full year 
 since they turned 18 and are drawing a check and have medicaid
-focus on those who are in line at walmart with vouchers to pay children they keep having when they can't afford it 
-STOP messing with the elderly people who at 65 have numerous health problems and need help 
-SHAME on you, attached are some of the conversations going on about elderly, chronic pain, opiod crisis crap, CARA bill what a joke.
-People who are going to abuse will do just that, if they were law abiding citizens they would not be abusing drugs or the system
to begin with.  You can pass all the bills and put all the rules in place you want to but it is not helping the people who truly need
help.

"736","CMS",FALSE,2,NA,NA,"I am a chronic/intractable pain patient, a pain patient advocate, and an Ambassador for Chronic Disease Coalition. I have had chronic/intractable pain for almost twenty years, suffering with endometriosis, ilioinguinal neuralgia, spinal stenosis, and DDD. I am permanently disabled and without cure. I am left with only palliative care, managing my pain. Since the ""opioid crisis"", my pain relief was forcibly reduced, and has been left undertreated. Therefore, I am left to live with what was once a symptom, but has now become a disease of its own, chronic pain disorder. My central nervous system has been changed by high levels of cortisol and nociception, causing high blood pressure, tachycardia, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and neurodegenerative problems. Most importantly, I have a profound loss of function from the forced reduction and a much lower quality of life. My heart breaks because I can no longer attend my child's school events or care for my family or home as I am mostly bedridden/housebound. There is a profound loneliness that happens when a pain patient can no longer socialize with their family and community due to undertreated pain. Things will only get worse for patients like me, stable for years on the same dose of opioid therapy, because of a scientifically unfounded threshold. 

As most patients, I use a multimodal approach to pain management, including a spinal cord stimulator and meditation, but the therapy that has overwhelmingly worked best for me is opiate therapy, considered with this petition to be over the arbitrary, unfounded limit. It is difficult to get access to the medications my physician, a respected board-certified pain medicine and anesthesiologist, needs me on now. When I spoke with him, he told me, as a physician, he is ""under immense pressure"" to conform to 90MME, and how dangerous these arbitrary caps on pain relief can be for patients like me, who have been in good standing with him and stable for the last seventeen years.  

An arbitrary cap like 90MME is dangerous to patients. Patients are given opioids as a last resort, titrated to analgesic effect. By removing physician discretion from this equation, we are removing an imperative part of the doctor-patient relationship, trust. I am astounded by the sheer number of patients I speak to daily as an advocate, stable on opioids for years, forcibly reduced or removed. These patients are faced with living in debilitating pain, going to the streets, or as many patients have had to choose, suicide. I am appalled at the increasing number of patient suicides from pain that are happening in the U.S. since the CDC Guidelines have been enforced as law across all specialties of physicians, including pain management. Patients have lost jobs and houses and now on our already overburdened federal assistance programs. Further blocking access to individualized, patient-centered opioid therapy with this petition would be catastrophic to the already damaged pain patient community. 

It is clear the scientific data and clinical evidence do not support any definitive dosage or duration threshold for addiction or overdose. The dosage and duration limits proposed by CMS are not supported by any sound scientific data and support a one-size-fits-all approach to prescribing. This approach would be problematic and inconsistent with the need for individualized, patient-centered treatment and the variability among patient responses to opioids. Physicians have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the individual patient at all times, and that the interests of the patient are to be held above all others, including those of the state. It is imperative for physicians to have the discretion when deciding with their patients to titrate dosage to analgesic effect that they not out of fear modify their treatment in an attempt to avoid regulatory attention. Fear of regulatory scrutiny of prescribing practices for opioid analgesics will undoubtedly drive treatment plans if these kinds of arbitrary binary scientifically unfounded thresholds become law. The persistence of irrational and unsubstantiated fears about addiction, morbidity thresholds, and adverse side effects of opioid analgesics have already grossly eroded the doctor-patient relationship.  

Pharmacogenetics has shown patients need certain genes to metabolize certain opioids, and there's great variability and fallibility in the morphine milligram equivalent calculations, which clearly do not take into account patient weight, tolerance, or genetic makeup, all exceedingly crucial in determining which opioid and dosage will achieve desired analgesic effects. Hindering this critical process would not only put the patient at significant risk for degenerative effects of undertreated pain, but also encourage physicians to forcibly taper or abandon patients. 
Granting any of these changes, arbitrary dosage thresholds or duration limits of pain relief will be catastrophic to patients and inhumane.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0956","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Stacey Turiello-IL"

Physicians will see this as government interference and choose to not prescribe pain medications at all, regardless of their patients needs. Medical students will absorb this false max dose as a limit to never be exceeded, without having any real understanding of the many reasons some patients require these higher doses. And again, the Morphine 90 mg mme is NOT A HIGH DOSE! Just because you say it is, does not make it so. Please do the right thing. Please do not enact these cruel and draconian measures. Please be the government I've always held respect for, the government that above all protects the most vulnerable citizens, not attacks and discriminates against them.

"799","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"To Whom It May Concern,
The Pain Committee of Kaweah Delta Health Care District (KDCHD) has concerns about the impact of the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' proposed rule changes for 2019 under the Medicare Advantage and Part D Act.  KDHCD is a 581 bed community teaching hospital located in Visalia, CA. It serves nearly 600,000 people in the Central Valley of California. Approximately 55% of the population  receives Medi-Cal benefits.  The population to primary care provider ratio is 2,350:1, almost twice the state average.   The Pain Committee is an interdisciplinary group of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses overseeing the inpatient and outpatient pain management policies of the Health Care District. The proposed changes will have a detrimental effect on the management of not only our patients but acute and chronic pain patients everywhere.  Specifically the Committee would like to bring the following to your attention: 
Page 210, paragraph 2: a one-time 7 day allowance to patients who meet the 90 Morphine milligram equivalents (MME) increases the burden to the patient and the prescriber.  In our area the number of pain management physicians is limited.  This change will be an undue burden for the prescriber who must reauthorize the prescription and justify the edit.  The fear is the added requirement will further limit access for patients to pain management providers and result in overutilization of the Emergency Department.  There should be a process to over-ride this one-time  fill if the situation arises.  For example, if a patient needs to be rotated to a different opioid agent what are the options to prevent lapses in therapy from a time delay in filling the new prescription?   
Additionally, there must be a logical process to continue opioids after 7 days, if needed.  Most patients will not require more than a 7 day supply of opioids for their acute pain but there are exceptions.  A process should be in place to help minimize the inconvenience to the patient and prescriber when offering appropriate treatment for complex medical problems causing subacute and chronic pain.  In our community, physician availability for many patients is limited.  Many patients may be unable to locate or make an appointment with a primary care provider within 7 days.  A process that authorizes prescriptions beyond this time for appropriate medical conditions should be in place, especially in medically underserved areas.    
Finally, there is concern that the proposed 2019 changes will increase the number of handwritten opioid prescriptions and increase the need for office visits to obtain such prescriptions.  This unduly burdens the health care provider and patients.  We appreciate the efforts to minimize the harm opioids cause and agree that rational restrictions on prescribing are in order.  However, avenues that allow for exceptions to the limitations placed on opioid prescribing should be available for prescribers dealing with complex medical problems and stable chronic pain patients especially in medically underserved areas.  
Respectfully submitted,

"834","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"A recent US federal review and clinical
guideline on opioids for chronic pain asserted that
the literature contributes no evidence on efficacy
because all trials had ""inadequate duration."" To explore
the evidence, we examined durations of studies
on opioid, nonopioid drug, and behavioral
therapies for chronic pain.

No common nonopioid treatment for
chronic pain has been studied in aggregate over
longer intervals of active treatment than opioids. To
dismiss trials as ""inadequate"" if their observation
period is a year or less is inconsistent with current
regulatory standards. The literature on major drug
and nondrug treatments for chronic pain reveals
similarly shaped distributions across modalities.
Considering only duration of active treatment in efficacy
or effectiveness trials, published evidence is
no stronger for any major drug category or behavioral
therapy than for opioids.

There are many articles (see full attachment) showing the benefits of opioids.
To put a hard edit at the POS in the pharmacy will just deny patients their opioid pain meds.
It will make MD/s not want to treat anymore and leave the profession.
THEREFOR, I DO NOT THINK THIS 2019 DRAFT CALL LETTER WITH HARD EDIT SHOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE.

Mended Hearts wishes to offer our comments on the Part D provisions of the proposed draft Call Letter titled, ""Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter,"" and particularly the proposal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit Part D Plans (PDPs) to substitute dietary supplements for prescription drugs in the Medicare Prescription benefit.  As a leading association representing heart patients across the lifespan, we are deeply troubled by the Agency's proposal and urge CMS to withdraw any reference to dietary supplements from the Call Letter when it is finalized. 

Mended Hearts is the largest peer to peer support network for cardiovascular patients in the world. We represent 20,000 members and provide support for over 200,000 patients every year. Our organization is located within 300 local communities across the country serving over 460 hospitals. Many of our patients rely on Medicare for their health care needs and we assert that the voice of the patient be protected in discussions, such as this determination presented. 
The Draft Call Letter (Part II), page 197, proposes to allow PDPs: ""to include additional OTC products such as dietary supplements and cough medicines, without the requirement that either product offset the use of a Part D drug.""  We object to this proposal, and urge CMS to withdraw it from the final Call Letter.  As explained below, dietary supplements are not equivalent to, and cannot be substituted for, prescription drugs; and they cannot be used to treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate disease.  Instead, dietary supplements are ""food""  not subject to any FDA approval and they have no place in the Part D Prescription Drug benefit.  

Mended Hearts believes that protecting the patient from harm should be first and foremost at the top of all discussions. Making informed decisions are vital to our patients and this proposed rule change would open patients to a false sense of security when looking towards dietary supplements in their total health care equation. The current regulations regarding dietary supplements do not provide consumers or health care providers with sufficient information on safety and efficacy to make informed decisions about the use of such supplements. And therefore, Mended Hearts is against such a policy change.

Introduction to the Letter Attached as PDF

The 180 clinicians signing the attached, separate letter wish to register our shared concern regarding opioid-related provisions in the ""2019 Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2019 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates, Part C and D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter, CMS 2017-0163."" The letter, titled ""Unhelpful and Risky"" was prepared on March 4, 2018. All signatures were collected in just 28 hours, underscoring the depth of our concern that patients will be put at risk if the proposed opioid-related provisions are enacted.

Three of us (Dr. Stefan G. Kertesz, Dr. Adam Gordon and Dr. Ajay Manhapra) prepared the letter. We are academic general internal medicine physicians with board certification in addiction medicine and a history of publication focused on addiction, primary care and current roles in enhancing opioid safety through our clinical work, research, and teaching. We have no grants, funding, honoraria or income related to the pharmaceutical industry now or in the past. Dr. Kertesz previously held privately-owned stock in Abbot and Merck (amounting to <3% of assets), sold in December of 2017.

The signature list for this letter was open to individuals with clinical degrees in fields such as medicine, pharmacy and nursing. All signatures represent individuals speaking on their own behalf. None speak on behalf of their employers, or any other organization with which they are affiliated. 

The list of signatories reflects deep and wide expertise directly relevant to the the CMS Proposal. 

The signatories include three persons who played roles in the development and finalization of the 2016 CDC Guideline on Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (Starrels, Cunningham, Bair). It includes two members of the Board of Directors for the American Board of Addiction Medicine (Friedmann, Samet), three past Presidents of the Association for Medical Education and Research on Substance Abuse (Alford, Samet), and two past Presidents of the Society of General Internal Medicine (Kroenke, Turner). 

A high percentage of respondents are active medical faculty at leading medical schools (several from Harvard, Yale, University of California San Francisco, Einstein, Boston University and Stanford). Moreover, our respondents encompass professional expertise in addiction, primary care, pain, pharmacy, nursing and palliative care. The respondents also include experts in opioid safety (Merrill, Alford, Manhapra, Webster, Gordon, Kertesz, Fox, among others), and psychological interventions for pain (Darnall). 

We understand that CMS, like all public and private agencies, seeks to foster a health system response appropriate to the magnitude of the crisis facing our nation. We hope you will read the attached letter with the understanding that we wish to be constructive while cautioning against actions that could do severe harm.

On behalf of the signatories,

I hope you are well.

I am not well. I am permanently crippled due to a crime in a case where the criminal was never csught.
A ""Disabled Crime Victim"" per se.

I am speaking on behalf of myself, my disabled 90 yr old grandmother, and disabled 95 yr old grandfather.

Who thinks its a good idea to require disabled people, the elderly, and cancer patients to refill their prescriptions every 7 days and give a urine sample as if they are some sort of criminal? Criminals on probation or paroll are retreated like this. Not law abiding citizens who don't have a criminal record.

The only type of person who could suggest such a thing would be a heartless, sadistic, or ignorant person. Or a combination of all three.

A simple 2 minute review of this idea would expose the inherint ignorance of this idea.
I really hope this isn't an attempt to decrease the number of incidence of people having criminal behavior with drug prescriptions.

THIS WILL ONLY HURT THE WEAKEST OF US AND ARE NOT WORTH THE TRADE-OFF AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF SUCH A POLICY.

Please count my vote as a **NO** and consider what I am saying.

DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME MOVING AROUND. I know personally. Making them find transportation 4 times a month to the Pharmacy and 4 times a month to a doctor for refills is prima facie heartless and sadistic.

This will have ZERO effect on drug abuse. 0%.
This will a neglegent effect on diverted medicine to the black market. x<0.01%

**This will have 100% effect on the abuse of elderly, disabled, and cancer patients. 100%.**

Who can afford the gas and co-pay of seeing a doctor and pharmacy 4 times a month?
Again, abandon this idea, and never let it return again. 
Thank you for your time.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0094","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","B. Grimes-TX"

""Untreated pain is tantamount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"" its time to stop this, denying pain control so people can get back to LIVING should be seen as genocide, letting insurance companies, pharmacies and the government be Drs is WRONG, the ""guidlines"" are now being used as law, and millions of Americans that were on a stable dose for YEARS, and having a job, a home, a family, have been forced to discontinue their medications, Do we deny heart patients their medications? And why on earth has the CDC stated that it's ok to give addicts MORE opiates, more anxiety medication and free rescue kits, when you are denying millions of responsible patients the SANE choices,? How backwards is that? They have recommended that addicts, continue to receive their OPIATE treatements, and their anxiety medications, even if they don't stay clean, YET, people in physical pain are denied ALL opiates, and if they are lucky enough to get ANY opiates, they are not allowed to get anxiety, or sleep medication at the same time? How is an addict allowed to get both, (so they will continue to be happy) but pain patients are not.? How is that even possible? Everything is backwards, denying care for one group of people and giving care to another group is discrimination,  how is Safe as u say for addicts to get all the meds tbey need and not sage for a responsible patient who has been fine and stable for YEARS!!!  I hope the opiate haters get what is coming to them, jail or maybe a car crash, or autoimmune disease.

"1090","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies, and 2019 draft Call Letter.
 
The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support, and research. Today, there are more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's, and it is the only cause of death among the top 10 without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. As the size and proportion of the United States population age 65 and older continue to increase, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias will grow. Caring for individuals with Alzheimer's cost an estimated $259 billion in 2017 with Medicare and Medicaid bearing $175 billion--67 percent--of that figure.  Thus, we encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to consider the following comments to improve both payment accuracy and care for this growing population of beneficiaries.
 
CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model for CY 2019
We support CMS's ongoing efforts to improve its risk adjustment model. We note that two dementia HCCs appear in the All Condition Count Model but not in the Payment Model. Merely counting dementia fails to account for the impact that dementia has on the management of other chronic conditions and the resulting increased costs to the system. Similarly, CMS has determined that the All Count Model improves accuracy for beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions but the Payment Model is more accurate for those with fewer chronic conditions. While most Medicare beneficiaries do not have so many co-occurring chronic conditions, 26 percent of beneficiaries over 65 with dementia have five or more of these conditions.  This results in higher than average per-person payments for most health care services for Medicare beneficiaries with dementia and serious coexisting medical conditions.  Given these increased costs and the growing population of beneficiaries who will have some form of dementia, we urge CMS to consider ways to account for the costs associated with these individuals. Additionally, plans that serve the sickest beneficiaries may experience a negative disproportionate impact without appropriate risk adjustment.

Existing Display Measure: Antipsychotic Use in Persons with Dementia (APD) (Part D)
The Alzheimer's Association appreciates CMS's ongoing efforts to reduce inappropriate antipsychotic use in persons with dementia. Historically, antipsychotic medications have been used appropriately and inappropriately to address some of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, aggression, and hallucinations. The Association fully supports that for all BPSD, non-pharmacologic interventions should be a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapies. However, the Association continues to support the appropriate use of medications when BPSD pose a greater risk to individuals and families living with dementia than the medications. 

Persons with dementia and families acknowledge the potential benefits of appropriately-used antipsychotics, even if the medication does not have an FDA-approved indication for their symptoms. They report that such medications can ease paranoia or anxiety and can alleviate the rage some people experience, keeping them and others safe and allowing them to remain in their homes. These medications may calm an agitated person for a few hours, allowing him or her to attend an adult day program, granting a caregiver a few hours of respite. Many persons with dementia and their families can make informed choices regarding the use of antipsychotic medications. This measure does not account for this informed consent, preference, and the potential improvements in the quality of life for some individuals. 

We strongly support CMS's decision to further examine diagnosis data and current use before adding the measure to the Star Ratings system.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. The Alzheimer's Association would be glad to serve as a resource to CMS as it considers these important issues and how they relate to individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias.

"1109","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"I fear for my life. I shouldn't have to fear for my life because of the actions of my Government. My Goverment should be protecting me. Not attacking me. Pain management is a basic human right, according to the World Health Organization. What kind of country do we live in when this right is blatantly ignored and the health of many placed in jeopardy? These measures violate my civil rights. When has it ever been acceptable for an insurance company to treat patients, to make medical decisions for them? I've never heard of this. I thought it was illegal. I don't see the Government placing dose restrictions on insulin or blood pressure medication. There's no difference here. Pain medication is as much a vital part of my treatment as insulin is to a diabetic. I am disabled due to an intractable pain condition called, Adhesive Arachnoiditis. It's a progressive inflammatory disease of the nerves of the spinal cord. My spinal cord is tethered, due to this condition. It causes severe, intractable pain 24/7 and causes many other limitations, including neurogenic bladder, chronic daily headaches and frequent migraines, to name only a few. These measures are a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. I am disabled. There's no guarantee that my doctor will agree to pursue the pre-authorization process. He may feel that this would bring too much attention upon him from the DEA and fear losing his license and livelihood. He may see this as cost prohibitive and decide to not exceed the Morphine 90mg mme for any of his patients, regardless of their need or whether the patient will be adversely impacted, including death due to complications from under treated pain, death and potentially suicide. He may see this as Government overreach and decide it's no longer safe to prescribe pain medication at all. The Government should stay out of my doctor's office and stop violating the doctor patient relationship. All these decisions about my care will be made about me, WITHOUT me. I will have no say in the decision process. If my doctor chooses to lower my dose or stop prescribing opioids at all, I will have no say. There's no appeal process for a physician's decision. And it's very difficult now to find a doctor to treat pain. Even pain management doctors have stopped prescribing opioids due to fear of the DEA. I'm not a candidate for spinal procedures, like injections, as they are contraindicated for Arachnoiditis. They can cause progression of the disease, including paralysis. I have tried everything else. Physical therapy makes my pain and mobility worse. I've tried every vitamin and supplement imaginable. They are expensive and of little help with my severe pain. Insurance doesn't cover alternative therapies, like acupuncture or massage therapy. Medical marijuana is not available here and I don't know if it would help me anyway. I do know that opioids help me function. They allow me to get out of bed each day and function on a limited basis. On a good day I take a short walk or go out to dinner. I've been on a stable dose for 3 years. I've reduced the dose twice, by choice. There's no medical reason to reduce my dose now. I have no history of drug abuse or addiction. I get no euphoria or high from them. I have zero cravings for them. I feel and function perfectly normal on my stable dose. But if my dose is forcibly reduced or worse, eliminated, I will not be ble to get out of bed. Taking a shower will be excruciating. I will be housebound and bedridden with no social life at all. I will go into adrenal fatigue, like I did when my condition first started and my pain was under treated. I had to go to a nephrologist to be worked up for Addison's disease. But under treated pain is what caused my electrolyte disturbance. If that happens again, adrenal failure is a real possibility. I fear for my life. I shouldn't have to fear for my life because of the actions of my Government. My Goverment should be protecting me.

I am disabled, I am 56 and have been disabled since I was 40, I have had 9 spinal surgeries and have lots of hardware stabilizing my spine, it continues to degenerate due to autoimmune diseases so I am left with daily chronic pain that has been managed by the use of opioids. I am a sober person, I hate using any type of medication that messes with my head, I wont use marijuana, I dont like to drink but yet now due to the issues a few people have with opioids in our country I am being taken off of my medications and my pain is increasing and Im being left to suffer. Doctors have spent years and lots of money to learn how to treat their patients, yes perhaps there are some bad ones out there and they should be removed from practice and maybe there are some people that have abused their drugs but NOT everyone! I have never asked to have my medication dose increased, nor have I ran out before I am to get my refill, I am just a mother, daughter and a grandmother that wants to have some happiness in her life, to live without suffering, to have some quality of life, to play with my dogs and spend time in my garden. Taking this issue to the pharmacies and to the government to decide is unfair to the patients that are truly suffering, but just because they don't have cancer now they wont get treated for their chronic pain, where is the humanity in this? Who has the right to decide my pain isnt real, I assure you if you looked at my body with the multitude of scars and the nuts and bolts sticking out of my back, you would be assured that it is truly real

"1186","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Some excellent commentary by Dr. Kertesz.  A well known internist and addiction treatment MD.

Be aware, that as the CDC Guideline acknowledged, dosage recommendations reflect limited scientific evidence. Kertesz emphatically concludes, ""When you make morphine equivalency guidelines mandatory, it's in violation of the CDC guidelines."" 

""Clinical decision making should be based on a relationship between the clinician and patient, and an understanding of the patient's clinical situation, functioning, and life context. The recommendations in the guideline are voluntary, rather than prescriptive standards. They are based on emerging evidence, including observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations. Clinicians should consider the circumstances and unique needs of each patient when providing care.""

Please read some articles about MME.  90MME is just a guideline.
Leave Doctors and patients alone.  No need for hard edit at POS.  Doctors are all VERY MUCH aware
of the doses they are prescribing.  We don't need more rules and regs.

"1191","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"As a fully-trained and very experienced Pain Medicine physician and addiction prescriber, I strongly believe that these unwarranted restrictions are unconscionable.  The CDC opioid guidelines were produced by a corrupt process, are not evidence-based, and could seriously injure tens of thousands of legitimate chronic pain patients. They have been discredited by all the top academic pain med school professors. These draconian measures will only drive legitimate chronic pain patients to the street to get illicit but effective pain relief.
