CMS will reprice hospital inpatient hospital outpatient skilled nursing facility and home health claims to reflect the most current wage indices and retabulate physician claims with the most current Geographic Practice Cost Index.  We will also reprice historical claims to account for legislative and regulatory changes made to payments to disproportionate share hospitals and reprice durable medical equipment claims to account for the change in prices associated with the competitive bidding program.  Repricing historical claims in conjunction with rebasing rates for 2019 ensures that the 2019 FFS rates for each county reflect the most current FFS fee schedules and payment rules.,Section B.

388,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,523,In the first step CMS is proposing to add the 2016 cost and enrollment data to and drop the 2011 cost and enrollment data from the historical claims experience used to develop new geographic cost indices for each county.  As a result the fiveyear rolling average will be based on original Medicare claims data from 20122016.  CMS will then perform a series of adjustments to the original Medicare data to estimate FFS rates per county explained below as successive steps.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
389,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,524,In the second step CMS will exclude hospice expenditures and FFS claims paid on behalf of cost plan enrollees from the 2016 claims.  Comparable adjustments were previously made to 20122015 claims data in the development of the FFS rates for prior years.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
390,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,525,For Puerto Rico CMS will continue to only include claims and enrollment for beneficiaries with Part A eligibility and Part B enrollment for all five years (20122016).  While most Medicare beneficiaries are automatically enrolled in Part B and must opt out to decline it beneficiaries in Puerto Rico must take affirmative action to optin to Part B coverage.  CMS continues to believe it is appropriate to adjust the FFS rate calculation in Puerto Rico used to determine MA rates so that it is based on beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Part A and Part B in order to produce a more accurate projection of FFS costs per capita in Puerto Rico.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
391,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,526,In 2017 and 2018 the Secretary had directed the Office of the Actuary to adjust the feeforservice experience for beneficiaries enrolled in Puerto Rico to reflect the nationwide propensity of beneficiaries with zero claims.  For the 2017 and 2018 Rate Announcements the Office of the Actuary evaluated experience exclusively for beneficiaries who were enrolled in both Parts A and B and were not dually eligible for Veterans Affairs (VA) coverage.  The 2018 study analyzed experience for calendar years 2011 through 2015 and only considered FFS beneficiaries enrolled midyear.  On average 14.4 percent of A and B Puerto Rico FFS beneficiaries were found to have no Medicare claim reimbursements per year.  This compares to a nationwide nonterritory proportion of 6.0 percent of FFS beneficiaries without Medicare spending.  These results were applied to the Puerto Rico FFS experience by adjusting the weighting of the enrollment and risk scores for the zeroclaim cohort to reflect the nationwide proportion of zeroclaim beneficiaries.  The resulting impact was measured as an average increase in the standardized FFS costs in Puerto Rico of 4.4 percent for 2011 through 2015.  Accordingly a 4.4 percent adjustment was then applied to the prestandardized Puerto Rico FFS rates supporting the CY 2018 ratebook development.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
392,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,527,We are considering whether a similar adjustment should be applied for 2019.  The Office of the Actuary will perform an analysis that is similar to the analysis performed in 2017 and 2018 but with an updated five years of data 20122016.  We welcome comments regarding a similar update to Puerto Ricos experience in the development of the 2019 FFS rate.  We will review the results of this study and any comments that we receive and we will specify in the final Rate Announcement any adjustment that we determine may be necessary based on those results and comments.,Section B.

394,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,529,In the third step CMS will reprice the historical inpatient hospital outpatient skilled nursing facility and home health claims from 20122016 to reflect the most current (i.e. FY 2018) wage indices and retabulate physician claims with the most current (i.e. CY 2018) Geographic Practice Cost Indices.  For 2019 CMS will also continue to adjust historical FFS claims to account for legislative changes to section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act and the enactment of 1886(r).  These changes reduced Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments to inpatient hospitals by 75 percent and created new uncompensated care payments (UCP) effective October 1 2013.  Consistent with the methodology implemented beginning in 2016 CMS will adjust claims for fiscal year (FY) 2012 and FY 2013 for each DSH hospital to reflect the reduction in DSH payments and the allocation of the UCP by incorporating the corresponding requirements of the final FY 2018 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) rule.  Similarly we are proposing to adjust the UCP represented in the FY 2014 through 1st quarter FY 2017 claims to reflect the requirements of the final FY 2018 IPPS rule.  For 2019 repricing for Puerto Rico inpatient claims will continue to reflect the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 (Pub. L. 114113 Division O section 601) which amended section 1886(d)(9)(E) of the Act.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
395,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,530,We will continue repricing Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) claims from 20122016 to reflect the most current DMEPOS prices associated with the Competitive Bidding Program(CBP) and will continue using the latest Round 1 and Round 2 prices in making these adjustments.  Section 1847(b)(5) of the Act requires that single payment amounts replace the current Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule amounts for selectedDMEPOS items in specific competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Eight HCPCS codes for diabetic supplies were included in the National Mail Order (NMO) program.  We will continue to include the latest single payment amounts for NMO DMEPOS items to reprice the historical payments for DMEPOS claims.  Section 1834(a)(1)(F) of the Act requires CMS to adjust the fee schedule amounts for DMEPOS furnished on or after January 1 2016 in nonCBAs based on information from the Competitive Bidding Program (CBP).  We propose using the 2018 fully adjusted fees to reprice the nonCBA FFS claims for 20122016.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost

404,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,539,We are also proposing an adjustment for populationbased payment models for a limited number of Pioneer ACO claims from 2014 2015 and 2016 and NGACO claims for 2016.  Under this optional feature of the model certain participants receive a monthly fee that ultimately offsets a percentage reduction in marginal FFS payments over the same year.  For each affected claim the reduction amount represents the portion of the fee associated with that particular claim and is therefore added back to the reduced FFS amount so that the total reimbursement amount is represented.,Section B.

420,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,555,Last year for CY2018 FFS per capita cost projections we did not apply the VA and DoD adjustments concurrently because we were unable to obtain the necessary data in time the CY2018 VA and DoD adjustments were the same as those used in the CY2017 ratebook development.  For CY 2019 we propose two related changes to the adjustment to fee for service (FFS) per capita costs for beneficiaries dually enrolled in Veterans Affairs (VA) andor the Department of Defense (DoD) health programs.  First we propose to adjust the FFS rates by the VA ratios and the DoD ratios using results from a study based on FFS data from calendar years 20112015.  Second to address potential double counting of the effect we are proposing to replace the separate VA and DoD adjustments with a consolidated adjustment.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
421,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,556,To approximate an adjustment to the county FFS payment rates for VA we first analyzed the cost impact of removing Veterans Affairs (VA) dualbenefit eligibles from the Medicare claims and enrollment.  Specifically we calculated the ratio of standardized per capita costs of all Medicare beneficiaries excluding VA dualbenefit eligibles (that is all nonveteran beneficiaries) to all Medicare beneficiaries (that is all beneficiaries) for each county.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
422,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,557,We then multiplied 2018 FFS rates by the ratios calculated and analyzed the resulting change in rates for each county.  We looked at the rate changes between the 2018 FFS rates calculated for all beneficiaries based on the new ratio and the old ratio.  The rate changes do not reflect the impact of any payment rate minimums.  OACT found that the impact for adjusting total FFS costs using the new ratio is that approximately 74 of the counties would receive an increase and 26 of the counties would receive a decrease.  The average of the impact on 2018 FFS rate is 3.78.  Additionally we have tabulated the impact of the VA adjustment on the CY 2018 QBP payment rates which are presented in the below Table B21.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
423,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,558,Similar analysis was done on Department of Defense (DoD) ratios.  This analysis was performed separately for all DoD and Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP)only enrollees to compare the average FFS costs to determine if there were significant differences between the DoD groups and the total Medicare population.  To approximate an adjustment to the county FFS payment rates we analyzed the cost impact of removing the dualbenefit eligibles from the Medicare claims and enrollment.  For this analysis dualbenefit eligibles were defined as those Medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible to receive care through the Department of Defense.  We calculated the ratio of standardized per capita costs of all Medicare beneficiaries excluding dualbenefit eligibles (DoD) to all Medicare beneficiaries (or all beneficiaries) for each county.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
424,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,559,We analyzed the ratios in counties with at least 10 members in the respective groups and found that there was no statistical significance of the DoD ratios but did find that the USFHPonly ratios were significant.  Accordingly adjustments were made to counties with at least 10 USFHP members and CMS then adjusted the FFS rates by the ratios calculated.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
425,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,560,Based on the analysis of Medicare claims for DoD dual enrollees for calendar years 20112015 we found that the impact for adjusting total FFS costs based on the new ratio and the old ratio is that approximately 5.3 of the counties would receive an increase and 0.2 of the counties would receive a decrease.  The average of the impact on 2018 FFS rate for DoD alone is 3.21.  Additionally we have tabulated the impact of the DoD adjustment on the CY 2018 QBP payment rates which are presented in the below Table B22.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
426,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,561,In the 2018 FFS rates the majority of counties had an adjustment for VA whereas less than 6percent or 179 of 3247 of the county FFS rates reflected an additional adjustment for DoD dualbenefit eligibles. Further the average absolute value of the adjustment for the counties with a DoD adjustment averaged only 0.4 percent in 2018.  Despite the relatively small impact of the DoD adjustment there could be interaction between the VA and DoD adjustment that was not accounted for in the methodology used in the CY 2018 rate development.,Section B.  Calculation of Fee for Service Cost
427,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,562,Therefore we are proposing to apply the DoD and VA adjustments concurrently for CY 2019 instead of the independent application of the adjustments for CY 2018. We believe that concurrent calculation of the adjustment will have minimal impact versus independent application of the adjustments and will eliminate the doublecounting impact of DoD and VA dualbenefit eligibles. The corresponding impact of the proposed consolidated VADoD adjustment on the CY 2018 QBP payment rates are presented in the below Table B23.

Similar to the nonESRD rate methodology we are proposing to reprice the ESRD historical inpatient hospital outpatient and skilled nursing facility claims from 20122016 to reflect the most current (i.e. FY 2018) wage indices and retabulate physician claims with the most current (i.e. CY 2018) Geographic Practice Cost Indices.  We are proposing to reprice the ESRD PPS dialysis claims for the years 20142016 given that 2014 was the first year that the dialysis PPS system was fully phased in.  We are also proposing to adjust historical FFS claims for ESRD beneficiaries to account for legislative and regulatory changes to the provisions under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act and the establishment of 1886(r).  These changes replaced 75percent of hospital Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments with uncompensated care payments (UCP) beginning on October 1 2013.

CMS proposes as a condition of the waiver of the bidding requirements and the waivers otherwise provided to EGWPs to establish payment amounts as described herein.  As in 2017 and 2018 for 2019 Part C entities offering employeruniononly group waiver plans would not be required to submit Part C bid pricing information in the Part C bid pricing tool.

For 2019 CMS proposes implementing an updated version of this ESRD risk adjustment model.  The ESRD model currently used in payment was implemented in 2012 and has not been recalibrated since then.  Therefore for 2019 we propose to update the ESRD model.  Furthermore the 21st Century Cures Act  allows all Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD to enroll in MA plans beginning in 2021 in addition to those already enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans when they enter ESRD status or able to enroll in MA plans under 42 CFR  422.50.  Since plan sponsors may experience an increase in the MA ESRD population in future years we believe that it would be preferable to update the ESRD model prior to that time and are proposing the implementation of an ESRD model calibrated on data that are more recent.  The updated version of the model will result in payment that is more accurate and provides MAOs time to adjust to payments based on this new model prior to experiencing potential increases in enrollment.,Section I.

To accommodate the high onetime cost of a transplant CMS makes payments over three months to cover the transplant and immediate subsequent services.  The first months factor is the largest as that is the month within which the transplant takes place while the factors for months 2 and 3 are smaller for posttransplant recovery.  CMS calibrated the payments by using feeforservice hospital stay payments for the transplant and physician and other services rendered for the hospital stay and the two months after discharge.  The national average was converted to a relative factor by dividing by the predicted national average expenditures for dialysis patients.  This allows CMS to use the State ESRD dialysis rates to make payments for beneficiaries who have a kidney transplant.,Section I.  ESRD Risk Adjustment Model for CY 2019

For a historical period (calibration year) the model estimates incremental cost for a variety of beneficiary characteristics (e.g. age and gender) and health conditions.  Each incremental cost known as a dollar coefficient is divided by the predicted average per capita expenditure for beneficiaries in Original Medicare in a given year to create relative factors.  Risk scores are the sum of relative factors assigned to each beneficiary based on their demographic characteristics and health status.  For beneficiaries in Original Medicare the average risk score is 1.0 in the denominator year.,Section L.  Normalization Factors

CMS applies a normalization factor to each years risk scores to account for the trend in risk scores  encompassing these coding and population changes  that CMS projects to occur between the denominator year and the payment year.  Effectively the normalization factor keeps the average risk score at 1.0 in the payment year for beneficiaries in Original Medicare.,Section L.  Normalization Factors

630,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,785,First it is important to keep the average risk score at 1.0 for beneficiaries in Original Medicare so that risk scores in the payment year align with the rates.  A risk score accounts for the degree to which a beneficiarys health status results in expected cost that are more or less than the expected cost of the average beneficiary in Original Medicare.  The rates which are the benchmarks for Part C bidding are standardized to represent the cost of an average beneficiary in Original Medicare in the payment year.  Normalization helps to ensure that risk adjustment results in payments for individual beneficiaries that are adjusted for relative differences in expected costs but on average would not change the expected per capita cost if Medicare Advantage enrolls beneficiaries with the same risk profile as Original Medicare.,Section L.  Normalization Factors
631,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,786,Second updating the normalization factor annually stabilizes payments between model calibrations.  Periodically CMS updates the risk adjustment model with more current data which resets the year that the average risk score is 1.0 (i.e. the denominator year).  Applying a normalization factor to risk scores to account for trend between the denominator year and the payment year provides yearoveryear stability and avoids the volatility that would otherwise occur in risk scores in years when the model is updated.,Section L.

Clinicians have two paths to choose from the MeritBased Incentive System (MIPS) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs). APMs are defined under section 1833(z)(3)(D) of the Act as a model under section 1115A of the Act (excluding a health care innovation award) the Medicare Shared Savings Program under section 1899 of the Act a demonstration under section 1866C of the Act or a demonstration required by federal law.  Advanced APMs are a subset of APMs that meet certain criteria including requiring participants to use certified EHR technology providing for payment for covered professional services based on MIPScomparable quality measures and either requiring participants to bear greater than nominal financial risk for monetary losses or being a Medical Home Model expanded under CMS Innovation Center authority (414.1415). Examples of Advanced APMs include certain tracks of the Medicare Shared Savings Program and Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC) Model.  By meeting threshold levels of participation in Advanced APMs (in terms of Part B payments or patient counts) eligible clinicians can become qualifying APM participants (QPs) for a year.  Eligible clinicians who are QPs for a year earn a lump sum 5 APM incentive payment and are excluded from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment.,Section O.  Quality Payment Program

Beginning in 2019 eligible clinicians who participate in Advanced APMs but do not meet the thresholds to become QPs on that basis will have the opportunity to qualify as QPs through the AllPayer Combination Option. The AllPayer Combination Option takes into account eligible clinician participation in both Advanced APMs and in Other Payer Advanced APMs which are nonMedicare payment arrangements that meet criteria similar to Advanced APMs ( 414.1420).,Section O.

This update involved adjustments to the Prescription Drug Event (PDE) data from the prediction year to approximate the 2019 benefit structure.  The adjustments to the PDE data are similar to those made in previous years model calibrations in that we incorporated the payment year 2019 plan liability in the coverage gap into the prediction year (2015) expenditure data.  For 2019 plan liability for nonLIS beneficiaries in the coverage gap will be 63 percent for nonapplicable (generic) drugs and 20 percent plan liability for applicable (brand) drugs in the coverage gap.  In addition we mapped all PDEs to the defined standard benefit across all phases of the Part D benefit.  All other things being equal the increase in plan liability due to the reduction in beneficiary cost sharing for nonapplicable drugs and applicable drugs will differentially affect the risk scores of LIS and nonLIS beneficiaries.  This is because plan liability for nonLIS populations relative to LIS populations will increase.,Section A.  Update of the RxHCC Model

For this recalibration for 2019 we maintained the use of diagnosis data from 2014 feeforservice (FFS) claims and MAPD RAPS files along with expenditure data from 2015 PDE records.  The use of 2015 diagnoses and 2016 expenditures would have included a mix of ICD9 diagnoses (January 2015  September 2015) and ICD10 diagnoses (October 2015  December 2015).  In order to maintain stability and reflect a year of diagnoses submitted under a single classification system we continued to use the 20142015 modeling sample for the 2019 recalibration.  Beneficiaries in the model sample had to be (1) FFS or Medicare Advantage (MAPD or MAonly) for all 12 months of the base year (2014) and (2) enrolled in a PDP or an MAPD for at least one month in the prediction year (2015).,Section A.

We imposed hierarchies on the condition categories ensuring that more advanced and costly forms of a condition are reflected with a coefficient at least as high as related conditions with lower severity.  The resulting dollar coefficients represent the marginal (additional) cost of the condition or demographic factor (for example agesex group lowincome subsidy status and disability status).,Section A.

815,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1031,In order to calculate risk scores for payment the dollar coefficients must be denominated to create relative factors.  For the PY 2019 model calibration we divided the dollar coefficient for each demographic factor and RxHCC in the model by the average predicted per capita expenditure in 2015.  Consistent with the decision to continue to use the 20142015 modeling sample for the recalibration CMS will continue to use a 2015 denominator to create the relative factors.  These relative factors are then used to calculate risk scores for individual beneficiaries in the payment year.  We developed the denominator for the revised RxHCC risk adjustment model using data from Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both MAPDs and PDPs which results in an average risk score for the enrolled Part D population in the denominator year of 1.0.  The denominator used to create relative factors for all segments of the model is 1062.31.,Section A.  Update of the RxHCC Model
816,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1032,When the RxHCC model is recalibrated to reflect an updated benefit structure it can result in changes in condition category coefficients.  Changes in the relative (denominated) factors can occur when the marginal cost attributable to an RxHCC changes differently than the average beneficiary cost.

823,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1039,The risk sharing payments provided by CMS limit Part D sponsors exposure to unexpected drug expenses.  Pursuant to section 1860D15(e)(3)(C) of the Act and  423.336(a)(2)(ii) of our regulations CMS may establish a risk corridor with higher threshold risk percentages for Part D risk sharing beginning in contract year 2012.  Widening the risk corridor would increase the risk associated with providing the Part D benefit and reduce the risk sharing amounts provided (or recouped) by CMS.  While CMS may widen the risk corridors the statute does not permit CMS to narrow the corridors relative to the 2011 thresholds.,Section C.  Part D Risk Sharing
824,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1040,CMS has evaluated the risk sharing amounts for 2008  2016 to assess whether they have decreased or stabilized.  A steady decline or stabilization in the Part D risk sharing amounts would suggest that Part D sponsors have significantly improved their ability to predict Part D expenditures.  However CMS has found that risk sharing amounts continue to vary significantly in aggregate from year to year and among Part D sponsors in any given year.  Therefore we do not believe it is appropriate to adjust the parameters at this time and we will apply no changes to the current threshold risk percentages for contract year 2019.  We will continue to evaluate the risk sharing amounts each year to determine if wider corridors should be applied for Part D risk sharing.,Section C.  Part D Risk Sharing
825,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1041,Thus the risk percentages and payment adjustments for Part D risk sharing are unchanged from contract year 2018.

An applicable drug is defined in section 1860D14A(g)(2) of the Act to generally include covered Part D brand drugs that are either approved under a new drug application (NDA) under section 505(b) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act or in the case of a biologic licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) (other than a product licensed under subsection (k) of such section 351) using a Biologics License Application (BLA).  Nonapplicable drugs generally are covered Part D drugs that do not meet the definition of an applicable drug such as generic drugs.  Note that nonapplicable drugs also include any biosimilar products or biologics licensed under section 351(k) of the PHSA using a BLA per section 1860D14A(g)(2)(A) of the Act.  The reductions in costsharing in conjunction with the Coverage Gap Discount Program will effectively serve to close the Medicare Part D coverage gap for nonLIS beneficiaries by CY 2020.,Section E.

1071,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,1393,CMS released an HPMS memo on September 28 2015 announcing information pertaining to the Part D Enhanced Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Model. The memo stated that CMS would offer a performancebased incentive payment in return for a minimum reduction 2 in Medicare costs of care and successful data and quality reporting.  The incentive will be set at a fixed 2.00 permember amount which is equal to the level of recent LIS benchmark de minimis amounts.  This performancebased payment will be in the form of an increase in government contribution to the plan premium i.e. as an increase in the direct subsidy component of Part D payment or an equivalent payment.  The plan would still be receiving the total payment specified in its bid not an additional addon payment.  However the governmentfunded portion of the monthly bid would increase and the beneficiary portion (premium) would correspondingly decrease for all plan enrollees.  Thus plan sponsors will submit standardized bids as usual based on their cost requirements and then any additional premium subsidy earned will be subsequently applied to the plan premium prior to its inclusion in CMS lowincomepremiumsubsidy calculations.  In other words the premium reduction will be considered in determining the lowincome premium benchmark.  Also the memo indicated that Performance results in model Year One (2017) will translate into a performancebased payment in Year 3 (2019).,Section H.

This Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) measure is the percentage of patients between 40 and 75 years old who received at least two diabetes medication fills and also received a statin medication during the measurement period.  Beneficiaries in hospice according to the Medicare Enrollment Database (EDB) are excluded from the denominator of the SUPD measure for the entire year. Beneficiaries with endstage renal disease (ESRD) at any time in the measurement year are also excluded. For the 2017 measurement year CMS proposes to expand its data sources for identifying all Part D enrollees with ESRD for exclusion from the measures to include ICD10CM codes found in both Part A  B claims and Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS) RxHCCs to use along with the EDB ESRD indicator that is currently used. We propose to add the SUPD measure to the 2019 Star Ratings (based on 2017 data) with a weight of 1 for the first year.

This measure was developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as part of HEDIS and is currently included as a display measure. It focuses on the percentage of males 21 to 75 years of age and females 40 to 75 years of age who were identified as having clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and were dispensed at least one high or moderateintensity statin medication during the measurement year. NCQA allows for the exclusion of certain conditions and symptoms that may indicate statin intolerance (e.g. myalgia myositis myopathy or rhabdomyolysis). Please refer to the NCQA HEDIS 2018 Technical Specifications for Health Plans Volume 2 for measure construction and technical specifications. We propose to include this measure in the 2019 Star Ratings as a process measure with a weight of 1 as it is based on medical records review if medications were prescribed.,Section I  Parts C and D

The Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) is adjusted for inpatient (IP) stays and hospice enrollment for MAPDs and PDPs and skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays for PDPs. In applying the adjustment first we identify the start and end dates of relevant types of stays for beneficiaries included in the adherence measures. The start date is currently the admission date and the end date is one day before the discharge date. The discharge date is not included in the PDC adjustment. The days of the relevant stays that occur during the beneficiarys measurement period are removed from the numerator and denominator of the PDC calculation. In addition we shift the days supply from Part D prescription fills that overlap with the stay to uncovered days after the end of the relevant stay if applicable.

After several solicitations for public comment on the BAPP measure and considering comments from MA plans advocates and other stakeholders CMS proposed in the CY2018 Advance Noticedraft Call Letter a number of revisions to the BAPP measure.  In response to that proposal commenters expressed overwhelming support to implement a revision to the measure decoupling audits and enforcement actions from Star Ratings.

This current measure collected through the Medicare HOS assesses the percentage of beneficiaries who discussed falls balance concerns or walking with their healthcare provider and received fall risk intervention(s) from the provider. NCQA made two changes to this measure. First NCQA changed the denominator of both indicators to include all beneficiaries age 65 and older as opposed to limiting the denominator to those age 75 and older or age 6574 with a balance problem walking problem or fall in the past year. This action removes a potential bias toward sampling only patients who were treated unsuccessfully. Second NCQA updated the list of example interventions by removing the phrase Check your blood pressure lying down or standing. This aligns the list of interventions with current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. This change required revising the underlying survey questions in HOS. The revised questions will be first collected in 2018. As a result of this there will be no data for this measure for the 2019 Star Ratings.

All contracts submitted data during the first year of the project. The first submission for the TMP was for the measurement year 2016 related to Part C organization determinations and reconsiderations and Part D coverage determinations and redeterminations. The timeframe for the submitted data was dependent on the enrollment size of the contract with smaller contracts submitting data from a threemonth period mediumsized contracts submitting data from a twomonth period and larger contracts submitting data from a onemonth period. CMS reviewed and examined the data from the first collection of TMP data but did not use it in the determination of appealsrelated reductions for the 2018 Star Ratings.,Section I  Parts C and D
4630,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,6699,CMS is proposing statistical criteria to reduce a contracts Star Rating for data that are not complete or lack integrity using TMP data or audit. The reduction would be applied to the measurelevel Star Rating for the applicable appeals measures. We are cognizant that there are varying degrees of data issues and as such we have developed a methodology for reductions that reflects the degree of the data accuracy issue for a contract instead of a onesizefitsall approach. The methodology would employ scaled reductions (onestar twostar threestar or fourstar reduction) based on the degree of missing IRE data. Contracts with the highest IRE data quality issues (i.e. largest percentage of missing or compromised data) would receive the largest reductions while contracts with a lower degree of missing IRE data would receive a smaller reduction. The most severe reduction for IRE data completeness issues would be a fourstar reduction thus resulting in a measurelevel Star Ratings of one star for the associated appeals measures.  If a contract receives a reduction due to missing Part C IRE data the reduction would be applied to both of the contracts Part C appeals measures.  Likewise if a contract receives a reduction due to missing Part D IRE data the reduction would be applied to both of the contracts Part D appeals measures. Further we propose to use multiple data sources whenever possible to determine whether the IRE data are complete and if not the severity of the missingness andor data issues.,Section I  Parts C and D
4631,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,6700,CMS proposed scaled reduction methodology would be a threestage process using the TMP data or audit for the means to determine first whether a contract may be subject to a potential reduction for the Part C or Part D appeals measures second as the basis for the determination of the estimated error rate and finally whether the estimated value is statistically greater than the cut points for the scaled reductions of 1 2 3 or 4 stars.,Section I  Parts C and D

A minimum error rate is proposed to establish a threshold for the identification of contracts that may be subject to a reduction.  The establishment of the threshold allows the focus of the possible reductions on contracts with error rates that have the greatest potential to distort the signal of the appeals measures.  Since the timeframe for the TMP or audit data is dependent on the enrollment size of the contract with smaller contracts submitting data from a threemonth period mediumsized contracts submitting data from a twomonth period and larger contracts submitting data from a onemonth period the use of a projected number of cases allows a consistent time period for the application of the criteria proposed.,Section I  Parts C and D

We propose to adjust the 2019 and 2020 Star Ratings to take into account the effects of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances that occurred during the performance period such as the disasters (Hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria and the wildfires in California) that occurred during the 2017 performance period.  CMS is also concerned that certain natural disasters and emergencies that continue into early 2018 may interfere in plans ability to conduct surveys needed for 2019 Star Ratings.

5054,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7295,We propose that the policy should be tailored to the specific areas experiencing the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance.  Health and drug plans can serve enrollees across large geographic areas and thus they may not be impacted in the same manner as healthcare providers such as hospitals or medical centers located in specific physical locations.  For purposes of this policy a narrower geographic scope than the full emergency area would ensure that the Star Ratings adjustments are focused on the specific geographic areas that experienced the greatest adverse effects from the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance and are not applied to areas sustaining little or no adverse effects.  We identify an area as having experienced extreme and uncontrollable circumstances if it is within an emergency area and emergency period as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act and also is within a county parish U.S. territory or tribal government designated in a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act that served as a condition precedent for the Secretarys exercise of the 1135 waiver authority (httpswww.phe.govemergencynewshealthactionssection1135Pagesdefault.aspx).

Individual Assistance includes assistance to individuals and households crisis counseling disaster case management disaster unemployment assistance disaster legal services and the disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  We focus on counties eligible for Individual Assistance as a result of a major disaster because most Star Ratings measures are based on services provided directly to beneficiaries in their local area. Therefore adjustments to the Star Ratings are most appropriately targeted to areas where beneficiaries were eligible for individual and household assistance as a result of the disaster.,Section I  Parts C and D
5056,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7297,To determine whether a contract was impacted (such as that it would be an affected contract eligible for adjustments) we propose to compare the number of enrollees in the Individual Assistance area at the time of the disaster compared to the number of enrollees outside the Individual Assistance area.  Using the Individual Assistance major disaster declaration as a requirement for the extreme and uncontrollable event policy ensures that the policy would apply only when the event is extreme meriting the use of special adjustments to the Star Ratings and targeting the specific area affected by the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance.,Section I  Parts C and D
5057,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7298,The Hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria and the recent California wildfires would trigger the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance policy as there were areas identified as emergency areas for emergency periods under Section 1135(g) as a result of these natural disasters there were Stafford Act declarations of a major disaster applicable to them the Secretary did exercise authority under Section 1135 of the Act as a result of these disasters and there are enrollees residing in FEMAdesignated Individual Assistance areas. During the measurement year for the 2019 Star Ratings the effects of Hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires were significant for Medicare beneficiaries as well as for the Parts C and D organizations that provide important medical care and prescription drug coverage for them.We propose to limit relief to these major disasters since they affected large regions of the United States leading to issues accessing medical care and prescription drug coverage.  Further plans complete many preventive screenings at the end of the calendar year so disasters in this period may have an inordinate impact on 2019 Star Ratings.  Finally beneficiaries responding to CMS surveys early in 2018 will be reflecting predominately on events in late 2017 so these disasters may impact survey results.,Section I  Parts C and D
5058,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7299,We are also proposing that contracts operating solely in Puerto Rico (i.e. with service areas limited to Puerto Rico) be treated as affected contracts without further analysis because of the extent of damage in that area.  Several areas remain without electricity in Puerto Rico and there are reports of significant population movement as a result of Hurricane Maria that are unique in scope to Puerto Rico compared to the other Individual Assistance areas designed by FEMA during 2017.

5062,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7303,For contracts that operate solely in Puerto Rico we propose to make the 2018 survey optional given substantial ongoing issues contacting enrollees in Puerto Rico the continuing loss of electricity in several areas etc.If a contract in Puerto Rico chooses not to administer the 2018 survey it would receive the contracts 2018 CAHPS Star Ratings for the 2019 Star Ratings.If a contract in Puerto Rico choses to administer the 2018 survey it would receive the higher of the 2018 or 2019 Star Ratings (and corresponding measure ratings) for each CAHPS survey measure (including the annual flu vaccine measure). We are proposing this relief because of concerns that the adjustment to the 2018 survey results may not capture all possible impacts of the major disasters given the possibility of unusual response patterns due to the scope of the disasters and we do not know what performance would have been observed in the absence of these disasters.,Section I  Parts C and D
5063,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7304,For other affected contracts the MA organization would be required to administer the 2018 CAHPS survey unless the contract requested and we approved an exception because a substantial number of their enrollees have been displaced due to a FEMAdesignated disaster in 2017 and it would be practically impossible to contact the required sample for the survey.  Our proposed adjustment is twofold  an adjustment for affected contracts and an additional adjustment for affected contracts with more than 25 of enrollees residing in FEMAdesignated Individual Assistance areas.,Section I  Parts C and D
5064,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7305,The CAHPS scores for affected contracts would be adjusted to account for the impact of the disaster.A CAHPS respondent would be considered to reside in a FEMAdesignated disaster area if the respondent lives in a FEMAdesignated Individual Assistance area at the time of the survey. This adjustment for nonPuerto Rico contracts would pool across contracts to develop separate estimates for each disaster.Unlike the usual procedures for casemix adjustment the coefficients would be estimated in a differenceindifferences manner (controlling for the previous years scores in the same contracts).In particular the estimated effect of a disaster would be the mean CAHPS score change from the previous year in affected counties minus the mean CAHPS score change from the previous year in unaffected counties both estimated from only the contracts that have sample in both the affected counties and unaffected counties. This approach distinguishes changes that were specific to the affected areas from overall trends in CAHPS scores and only adjusts for the change in CAHPS scores that is specific to the affected areas. We propose to only adjust if the effects are in a consistent direction and adjustment is advantageous to contracts.,Section I  Parts C and D
5065,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7306,We further propose that affected contracts with more than 25 of beneficiaries residing in affected Individual Assistance areas at the time of the disaster would receive the higher of the 2018 or the adjusted 2019 Star Ratings (and corresponding measure ratings) for each CAHPS measure (including the annual flu vaccine measure). We chose the 25 cutoff based on analysis of the distribution of the data for the percent of enrollees per contract in the Individual Assistance areas at the time of the disasters.

Contracts tend either to have very few enrollees impacted or most of their enrollees impacted. If one out of four enrollees were impacted during the period of the year when the disaster hit there is a small chance that scores may have been impacted.  If very few enrollees in a contract lived in impacted areas during the disaster period the measurelevel scores should not be impacted.  The selection of the exclusion of numeric measures scores from contracts with 60 or more enrollees impacted from the determination of the cut points was chosen through an analysis of the distribution of the percent of enrollees impacted by contract across all contracts impacted.  The 60 was chosen since there was a break in the distribution.  Our approach in selecting 60 is conservative in case scores are impacted in contracts where a clear majority or all of the enrollees are impacted.  We welcome comments on these policies to account for the potential impact on the 2019 Star Ratings from the widespread disasters in 2017.,Section I  Parts C and D

This measure is a riskadjusted measure that assesses the rate of hospitalization for complications of chronic and acute ambulatory caresensitive conditions. The measure is therefore an important indicator of care coordination where hospitalizations represent a failure to prevent a serious complication. However concerns raised by experts and stakeholders have led NCQA to consider updating the specifications to include hospital stays that are considered observation stays to improve completeness of the measure. That is observation stays can also represent a failure to prevent serious complications. Therefore we propose to retain this measure as a 2019 display page measure. We will propose through rulemaking moving it to Star Ratings with a weight of 1 for the 2022 Star Ratings. In subsequent years we intend to weight it 3 as an outcomes measure.

This measure is defined as the percent of appeals requiring effectuation that the plan effectuated in a timely manner (timely is defined as effectuation of the decision within one day for expedited appeals and effectuation of the decision within three days for standard appeals). If the IRE does not receive a notice of effectuation before the report generation date the IRE will count the effectuation as nontimely. Currently this measure includes all data applicable to the time period being reported as of the date the report is generated by the IRE.  Data may change based on the report date. Discrepancies may also result if the IRE received the effectuation notice late even though the plans effectuation was timely. Reopenings of appeals may extend into the following contract year which can impact effectuation data.  In order to allow for these factors we propose to modify this measure to be defined as all appeals received by the IRE in the defined timeframe. To account for reopenings and appeals that straddle the contract year all decisions from this time period will be included up to May 1st of the following contract year. For example the CY 2019 display measures timeframe would be IRE cases received from 1118  123118 with decisions made before 5119.  Effectuations for appeals decided on or after May 1 2019 that correspond to an appeal received 1118  123118 will not be reflected in these data and the timeliness of the reconsideration will be used.

NCQA is exploring several revisions to the HEDIS Plan AllCause Readmissions measure based on feedback they have received from the field and stakeholders. These revisions may impact the definition of the denominator numerator and risk adjustment model for data collected in 2018. The specific revisions they are exploring include 1) Inclusion of observation stays in the denominator and numerator 2) revising the measure denominator to be the overall plan population as opposed to index hospital admissions and 3) adding death in the measurement year as a possible factor in the risk adjustment model for this measure. NCQA is also considering stratifying this measure to separate those individuals with high frequency of index hospital stays. These changes are pending NCQAs analyses. CMS is also proposing to combine the rates for ages 1864 and ages 65 for the revised PCR measure. The revised measure would use NCQAs new recommendation of 150 as the minimum denominator value for data to be used. The revised measure would be part of the display page for 2019 and 2020 before moving to the 2021 Star Ratings with a weight of 1 the first year and a weight of 3 thereafter. The current Plan AllCause Readmissions measure would remain in the Star Ratings through 2020.,Section I  Parts C and D

NCQA is evaluating the clinical appropriateness and feasibility of excluding individuals with advanced illness from selected HEDIS measures. While HEDIS measures are designed to compare the quality of care provided to general populations or diseasespecific care provided to individuals with a chronic condition these measures may not be clinically appropriate for certain individuals with advanced illness and may overlook the quality issues that are specific to these patients. NCQA is therefore assessing the need for having exclusions for selected HEDIS measures for patients with advanced illness where providing certain treatments and services may not be appropriate. NCQA is exploring which specific illnesses and healthcare utilization may warrant an exclusion and to which measures the exclusion should be applied.

The MA ValueBased Insurance Design (MAVBID) model test is an opportunity for MAOs to offer supplemental benefits or reduced cost sharing to enrollees with CMSspecified chronic conditions focused on the services that are of highest clinical value to them. The Part D Enhanced MTM model tests whether providing Part D sponsors with additional payment incentives and regulatory flexibilities will engender enhancements in the MTM program leading to improved therapeutic outcomes while reducing net Medicare expenditures. We note that some stakeholders have expressed concern regarding the potential for the improvements in quality resulting from these tests to adversely influence the Star Ratings of contracts that are ineligible to participate (or that include some PBPs ineligible to participate).

CMS has waived the MTM requirements under Section 1860D4(c)(2) and 42 CFR 423.153(d) and the Part D Reporting Requirements for MTM for Part D plans participating in the Part D Enhanced MTM Model. However Part D sponsors with plans participating in this model must establish MTM programs in compliance with current requirements and reporting data for the remaining plans under each Part D contract. Therefore the MTM Program CMR Completion Rates will be calculated using available planreported data from the remaining plans under the Part D contract.

It is generally accepted that a high burden of anticholinergic use is consistently associated with cognitive impairment and increased risk of dementia in older adults. The rate distributions show variability in use across both MAPD and PDP contracts suggesting an opportunity for improvement to reduce the use of multiple concurrent ACH medications within Part D enrolled older adults. We propose to begin reporting the PolyACH measure in the Patient Safety reports for the 2018 measurement year. We plan to add the measure to the display page for 2021 (2019 data) and 2022 (2020 data). We will consider this measure for the 2023 Star Ratings (2021 data) which would be proposed through rulemaking.,Section I  Parts C and D

We adjusted the measure for memberyears and evaluated the number of contracts with greater than 30 memberyears in the denominator. A total of 736 out of 743 Part D contracts in 2016 (668 MAPDs 63 PDPs and 5 employer direct contracts) had a beneficiary who met the eligibility requirements for the PolyCNS measure. When the greater than 30 memberyear denominator criterion was applied the total number of MAPD and PDP contracts decreased to 698. Over 5 of MAPD contracts and 9 PDP contracts were excluded.

We plan to add the measure to the display page for 2021 (2019 data) and 2022 (2020 data). We will consider this measure for the 2023 Star Ratings (2021 data) pending rulemaking. However we seek feedback if there are concerns with adding this measure for the following reasons (1) the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) identifies potential opioid overutilizers who are also receiving a benzodiazepine and (2) a proportion of the concurrent opioid and benzodiazepines users will already be identified within the PolyCNS measure.,Section I  Parts C and D

The low prevalence of multiple sclerosis in many Part D contracts resulted in 19 of contracts having no members eligible for the ADHMS measure and over 25 of contracts having a 100 adherence rate.  Although the prevalence of NWOA use is much higher and only 4 of contracts had no members eligible for ADHNWOA measure many contracts had small denominators (less than 30 memberyears). A total of 512 (69) and 276 (37) of MAPD and PDP contracts had 30 or fewer memberyears in the denominator for the ADHMS and ADHNWOA measures respectively. Low denominators can affect the utility of a measure to assess contract performance. Currently four adherence measures are already included in the Patient Safety reports (three are included in Star Ratings) so we are not considering adding these adherence measures to the Patient Safety reports the display page or Star Ratings at this time.  However given the high cost of these medications and the importance of adherence for achieving positive outcomes we may consider including these measures within the quarterly outlier reports to Part D contracts through the Patient Safety Analysis Website in the future along with the beneficiarylevel data so contracts can focus adherence improvement efforts for these members.,Section I  Parts C and D

We will continue to analyze existing ratings measures to determine if measure scores are topped out or showing high performance across all contracts. In making decisions to transition such measures to the display page CMS does not have a strict formula. Although some measures may show uniform high performance across contracts with little variation between them we want to balance how critical the measures are to improving patient care the importance of not creating incentives for a decline in performance after the measures transition out of the Star Ratings and the availability of alternative related measures. If plans have only recently achieved uniformly high performance for example or if no other measures capture a key focus in Star Ratings a topped out measure may be retained in Star Ratings.,Section I  Parts C and D

5452,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7727,CMS currently requires sponsoring organizations that have more than five program audit conditions in their final audit report to hire an independent auditing firm to conduct a validation audit.  CMS conducts the validation audits of sponsoring organizations that fall below this threshold.  We are seeking comments on whether this threshold should be increased or decreased or limited to conditions that may cause adverse impacts to beneficiaries.  Our proposal described below aims to exclude a category of conditions from consideration in the threshold because they do not directly and adversely impact beneficiaries.,Section I  Parts C and D
5453,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7728,During the validation listening session sponsoring organizations requested flexibility regarding the threshold for requiring an independent audit asserting that there were challenges with hiring an independent auditing firm when only a limited number of conditions required validation.  In response to this comment we propose to modify the threshold used to determine when a sponsoring organization must hire an independent auditing firm.  Specifically CMS intends to exclude Compliance Program Effectiveness (CPE) conditions from the threshold calculation.   The identification of CPE conditions in a program audit indicate weakness(es) in a sponsoring organizations compliance program and its ability to prevent detect and correct Medicare Parts C or D program non compliance and fraud waste and abuse (FWA) in a timely and welldocumented manner.  As such CPE conditions require a customized audit approach that specifically tests correction of the issue but usually requires a lower level of effort from auditors to determine if the noncompliance has been corrected.  For this reason we believe that it is appropriate to exclude these conditions from the threshold calculation.  Sponsoring organizations with more than five nonCPE conditions cited in their final audit report will be required to hire an independent auditing firm.  CMS will conduct the validation audits of sponsoring organizations that fall below this proposed threshold.

In an effort to remain transparent with enrollees when sponsoring organizations receive a CMP for violations of program requirements starting with the 2019 Annual Election Period (AEP) CMS intends to display an icon or other type of notice on Plan Finder for sponsoring organizations that have received a CMP.CMS expects that the icon or notice would provide current enrollees and prospective enrollees with general information about a CMP and may link to the CMP letter on the CMS website for that particular sponsoring organization.This would be consistent with how CMS currently displays a sanction icon on Plan Finder for sponsoring organizations that have been subject to intermediate sanctions (CMP icon however will not block enrollments into the plan). This action is consistent with CMSs obligation under section 1851(d) of the Act to provide information to enable beneficiaries to make an informed enrollment decision and the requirements at 42 C.F.R.  422.111(g) and 423.128(f) which allow CMS to require the disclosure of a sponsoring organizations performance and contract compliance deficiencies to current andor potential enrollees.,Section I  Parts C and D

These audits require extensive sponsoring organization resources and entail conducting a review of processes and outcomes discussions with employees and firsttier downstream and related entities (FDRs) and preparing documentation and demonstrating compliance with program requirements. CMS performs program audits of 3040 sponsoring organizations every year and these audits include a review of compliance program effectiveness. This includes assessing whether they are compliant with establishing and maintaining compliance programs which include measures to prevent detect and correct Parts C or D program noncompliance and fraud waste and abuse. When selected for a CMS program audit sponsoring organizations are still required to perform an internal annual compliance program effectiveness (CPE) audit CMS has received multiple inquiries from stakeholders expressing the burden on sponsoring organizations when they have to perform their own internal CPE audit while also being responsive to a CMS program audit in the same year. Many sponsoring organizations have adopted our CMS audit protocols to perform their own internal audits which results in a duplication of effort.  The industry has inquired if sponsoring organizations may consider a CMS program audit as satisfying the annual audit of their compliance program.,Section I  Parts C and D
5486,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7761,CMS is considering allowing sponsoring organizations that have undergone a program audit to treat the program audit as meeting the annual compliance program audit requirement in 42 C.F.R.  422.503(b)(4)(vi)(F) 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(F) for one year from the date of the CMS program audit. CMS is seeking comment on this. The one year time frame would allow sponsoring organizations to complete their CMS CPE program audit process and remediation before a new CPE audit is initiated by the sponsor to evaluate compliance performance. CMS also requests comments on how this will impact burden for sponsoring organizations undergoing a program audit. CMS believes that it will reduce burden on sponsoring organizations already undergoing a CMS program audit and will eliminate the duplication of effort.  Additionally we believe it will allow time to implement appropriate corrective actions in response to the CMS audit and monitor implementation of those corrective actions to ensure that they are effective. It should be noted that nothing in this proposal would eliminate the more significant requirements in 42 C.F.R.  422.503(b)(4)(vi)(F) and 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(F) which require sponsoring organizations to conduct internal auditing and monitoring of their operations as well as the operations of their FDRs to ensure compliance with Medicare program requirements.,Section I  Parts C and D

By limiting excessive increases in the TBC from one year to the next CMS is able to make sure enrollees who continue enrollment in the same plan are not exposed to significant cost increases. As in past years CMS will evaluate TBC for nonemployer plans (excluding DSNPs).  MA plans offering Part C uniformity flexibility (discussed later in this section) andor participating in the ValueBased Insurance Design (VBID) model test will be subject to the TBC evaluation for CY 2019 however benefits and cost sharing reductions (entered in Section B19 of the PBP) that are offered as part of Part C uniformity flexibility or the VBID model test will be excluded from the TBC calculation.

As clarified in previous Call Letters the innetwork MOOP amount dictates the combined MOOP range for PPOs (i.e. PPOs are not permitted to offer a combined MOOP amount within the mandatory range while having an innetwork MOOP amount within the voluntary range).,Section II  Part C

Actual data for Parts A and B services are based on claims from the National Claims History files. The Office of the Actuary conducts an annual analysis to help CMS determine the proposed MOOP amounts by projecting cost sharing using trend factors such as enrollment changes and enrollment shifts between MA and Original Medicare. The mandatory MOOP amount represents approximately the 95th percentile of projected beneficiary outofpocket spending.  Stated differently five percent of Original Medicare beneficiaries are expected to incur approximately 6700 or more in Parts A and B deductibles copayments and coinsurance.  The voluntary MOOP amount of 3400 represents approximately the 85th percentile of projected Original Medicare outofpocket costs.,Section II  Part C
5608,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,7899,Since the MOOP requirement was finalized in 42 C.F.R.  422.100(f)(4) and (5) a strict application of the 95th and 85th percentile would have resulted in MOOP limits fluctuating from yeartoyear.  CMS has exercised discretion to maintain stable MOOP limits from yeartoyear if the beneficiarylevel distribution of Parts A and B cost sharing for individuals enrolled in Original Medicare is approximately equal to the appropriate percentile.  This approach avoids enrollee confusion allows plans to provide stable benefit packages and does not discourage the adoption of the lower voluntary MOOP amount if the limit increases one year and then decreases the next.,Section II  Part C

Also any dualeligible enrollee exempted from cost sharing who loses hisher Medicaid eligibility may be responsible for cost sharing for the period they have lost Medicaid coverage and remain enrolled in the DSNP.  This also applies to Zero Dollar Cost Sharing Plans that apply cost sharing in their Medicare Part A and B benefit package but enroll only dualeligible individuals who are exempt from cost sharing.,Section II  Part C

Table 24 below summarizes the standards and cost sharing amounts by MOOP type (e.g. mandatory or voluntary) for MA plans that we will not consider discriminatory or in violation of other applicable standards.  CY 2019 bids must reflect enrollee cost sharing for innetwork services no greater than the amounts displayed below.  These standards will be applied only to innetwork Parts A and B services unless otherwise indicated in the table.  All standards and cost sharing are inclusive of applicable service category deductibles copayments and coinsurance but do not include plan level deductibles. Inpatient and Skilled Nursing Facility (Days 21 through 100) standards have been updated to reflect estimated changes in Original Medicare cost for CY 2019. Per our authority at 42 C.F.R. 422.113(b)(2)(v) the Emergency CarePost Stabilization Care limit for plans has been increased for CY 2019 to better align cost sharing with actual costs and as an incentive to use primary and specialty care services for routine care and avoid using the emergency room for nonemergent routine services. The voluntary MOOP amount increased from 100 to 120 while the mandatory MOOP amount increased from 80 to 90. CMS expects having different limits based on the plans MOOP amount will encourage organizations to offer benefit packages with a lower voluntary MOOP amount while maintaining beneficiary protection.,Section II  Part C

5781,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8110,MAOs have the option to charge either coinsurance or a copayment for most service category benefits.  For example based on the cost sharing requirements indicated above for Part B Drugs  Chemotherapy a plan can choose to either assign up to a 20 coinsurance or 75 copayment to that particular benefit. MA plans may not charge enrollees higher cost sharing than is charged under Original Medicare for chemotherapy administration including chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy integral to the treatment regimen skilled nursing care and renal dialysis services (42 CFR 422.100(j)).  Although CMS has not established a specific service category cost sharing limit for all possible services CMS has a longstanding interpretation of the antidiscrimination provisions that payment of less than 50 of the contracted (or Medicare allowable) rate and use of cost sharing for services that exceeds 50 of the total MA plan financial liability for the benefit discriminates against enrollees who need those services.  If a plan uses a copayment method of cost sharing then the copayment for an innetwork Original Medicare service category cannot exceed 50 of the average contracted rate of that service (Medicare Managed Care Manual Chapter 4 Section 50.1).

Some PBP service categories may identify specific benefits for which a unique copayment would apply (e.g. category 3 includes specific benefits for cardiac rehabilitation intensive cardiac rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation services) while other categories include a variety of services with different levels of costs which may reasonably have a range of copayments based on groups of similar services (e.g. category 8b includes outpatient diagnostic radiological services).

An item or service that meets all three conditions may be proposed as a supplemental benefit in an MA plans bid and submitted plan benefit package.

CMS has not previously allowed an item or service to be eligible as a supplemental benefit if the primary purpose is daily maintenance.  However medical and health care research has demonstrated the value of certain items and services that can diminish the impact of injuries or health conditions and reduce avoidable emergency and health care utilization. For example fall prevention devices can be an effective means to assist enrollees at high risk of fall and protect against the likelihood of additional injury resulting from a fall CMS believes provision of a fall prevention device  and similar items and services that diminish the impact of injurieshealth conditions and reduce avoidable utilization  could be provided as a supplemental benefit for a defined period of time and in certain situations.,Section II  Part C

Section 1852(a)(3) permits the offering of healthcare benefits as supplemental benefits but does not define the term.  We therefore have authority to interpret the term more broadly than we have in the past to permit MA plans to offer additional benefits as supplemental benefits so long as they are healthcare benefits.  Under our new interpretation in order for a service or item to be primarily health related  it must diagnose prevent or treat an illness or injury compensate for physical impairments act to ameliorate the functionalpsychological impact of injuries or health conditions or reduce avoidable emergency and healthcare utilization.  Any supplemental health benefit proposed by an MA organization must be reasonably and rationally encompassed by this standard.

We have determined that the statutory provisions at sections 1852(d)(1) and 1854(c) and the regulation at  422.100(d) mean that we have the authority to permit MA organizations the ability to reduce cost sharing for certain covered benefits offer specific tailored supplemental benefits and offer lower deductibles for enrollees that meet specific medical criteria provided that similarly situated enrollees (that is all enrollees who meet the identified criteria) are treated the same and enjoy the same access to these targeted benefits.  Targeted supplemental benefits can be offered through a benefit package that ensures equal treatment of enrollees with the same clinical conditions for whom such services and benefits are useful consistent with section 1852s equal access and antidiscrimination provisions and is priced at a uniform premium consistent with the requirement for uniform bids and premiums in section 1854(c) of the Act.

MA regulations (e.g. 422.100(f)(2) and 422.110(a)) reiterate and implement this nondiscrimination requirement.  In interpreting these obligations to protect against discrimination CMS has historically indicated that the purpose of the requirements is to protect highacuity beneficiaries from adverse treatment on the basis of their higher cost health conditions.  (79 FR 29843 76 FR 21432 and 74 FR 54634.)  As MA plans consider implementation of flexibility in the uniformity requirement they must be mindful of ensuring compliance with nondiscrimination responsibilities and obligations.  CMS will be concerned about potential discrimination if an MA plan is targeting cost sharing reductions and additional supplemental benefits for a large number of disease conditions while excluding other conditions particularly highercost conditions.  We will review benefit designs to make sure that the overall impact is nondiscriminatory and that higher acuity higher cost enrollees are not being excluded from these targeted benefits in favor of healthier populations.,Section II  Part C

CMS is revising its interpretation of the regulations to allow MA plan segments to vary by supplemental benefits premium and cost sharing consistent with the MA regulatory requirements defining segments at 422.262(c)(2).

5837,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8166,CMS wants to remind MAOs that the cost plan competition requirements will first be effective in 2019 that is cost plans affected by these requirements will first be unable to offer a cost plan in a service area or portion of a service area in contract year 2019.  Under amendments to section 1876(h)(5)(C) of the Act implementation of the cost plan competition requirements was delayed until the end of contract year 2018 by MACRA.,Section II  Part C
5838,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8167,CMS will nonrenew any portion of a cost plans service area if there are at least two competing MA local or two MA regional coordinated care plans with a minimum of 5000 enrollees (urban areas) or 1500 enrollees (nonurban areas) for the entire year prior to the nonrenewal. We used 2017 enrollment data to determine the cost plans subject to nonrenewal pursuant to section 1876(h)(5)(C).

5840,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8169,CMS continues to seek opportunities to maximize the potential for DSNPs to align benefits and improve coordination for MedicareMedicaid enrollees.  In previous Call Letter cycles we sought stakeholder input on a variety of opportunities for greater integration and coordination.  Based on that feedback CMS has identified certain priority areas for further integration for interested states and plans.  We have begun to work on some of these priorities  including with regard to oversight integrated model materials nonrenewals and models of care  with certain states and welcome the opportunity to expand this work and to partner with additional states in which there are integrated DSNP products available to MedicareMedicaid enrollees.,Section II  Part C
5841,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8170,We have identified the following specific areas in which administrative alignment for integrated DSNPs is currently feasible within existing statutory regulatory  and operational constraints,Section II  Part C

In response to previous stakeholder comments on this topic we have prioritized the following materials,Section II  Part C
5844,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8173,Summary of Benefits.  The Summary of Benefits (SB) is a brief summary of plan benefits and costsharing which as described in sections 30.6 100.1 and 100.2.2 of the Medicare Marketing Guidelines (MMG) (interpreting 422.111) must be posted on MA plan websites by September 30 each year provided with any enrollment form and available upon request to members. Starting with the CY 2017 cycle integrated DSNPs have had flexibility to display integrated Medicare and Medicaid benefits as applicable in their SBs. CMS worked with Minnesota to  develop model SB language for integrated DSNPs to use there in CY 2018 and based on that work is working with Massachusetts to develop similar model language for integrated DSNPs to use in that state for CY 2019.,Section II  Part C

Plans must send an ANOC summarizing changes to plan benefits for the upcoming contract year to current enrollees for receipt by September 30 each year under 422.111.  In addition plans must provide  at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter  an EOC containing detailed plan and benefits information..  Starting with the CY 2018 cycle the standardized ANOC and EOC models for DSNPs include new opportunities for integrating Medicare and Medicaid benefit descriptions similar to those available in the SB guidance.,Section II  Part C

Plans must make network provider and pharmacy information available at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter (by posting on the plan website by September 30 and making hard copies available).  Based on our work with MedicareMedicaid Plans and with DSNPs in the Minnesota Demonstration to Align Administrative Functions for Improvements in Beneficiary Experience we believe that inclusion of all available providers  including those offering services only covered through Medicaid  in one document will facilitate beneficiary understanding of both their Medicare and Medicaid provider choices and streamline health plan processes. For the last several contract years CMS has worked with Minnesota to develop model language based on MMP templates that would allow health plans to integrate this information into one document for use in that state that satisfies both Medicare and Medicaid regulatory requirements. Based on that work we are working with Massachusetts to develop similar model language for integrated DSNPs to use in that state for CY 2019.,Section II  Part C

Plans must make a formulary available at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter (by posting on the plan website by September 30 and making hard copies available).  Similar to directories we believe integration of Part D and Medicaidcovered prescription and overthecounter drugproduct information in one document is beneficial to both plan enrollees and to health plans.  As with the SB and directory CMS has some experience developing model materials for integrated DSNPs in Minnesota and is working with Massachusetts to develop integrated formulary model language for integrated DSNPs to use in that state for CY 2019.,Section II  Part C

States interested in requiring their contracted DSNPs to include additional information in their Model of Care (MOC) submissions about the provision of MLTSS and their integration with the medical and prescription drug benefits the plans provide under their Medicare contract may do so via their State Medicaid Agency contracts (which are required for all DSNPs under 42 CFR 422.107). CMS offers interested states with integrated DSNPs the opportunity to work with such contracted DSNPs to include additional information in MOC submissions and to review the integrated MOC submissions concurrent with the review of the plans MOCs by the National Committee for Quality Assurance pursuant to 42 CFR 422.152(g).,Section II  Part C
5850,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8179,We have successfully implemented an integrated MOC submission and review process with MMPs under the Financial Alignment Initiative as well as with the DSNPs participating in the Minnesota Demonstration to Align Administrative Functions for Improvements in Beneficiary Experience since 2014. As part of that effort Minnesota has required plans to add information to their MOC submissions about how the training for care coordinators incorporates the states MLTSS requirements how the state MLTSS assessment and level of care tools are coordinated with the Health Risk Assessment process and how the Individualized Care Plan (ICP) integrates Medicare and Medicaid services including MLTSS addresses the process for coordinating medical and social services identified in the ICP and addresses staterequired MLTSS care plan elements. Minnesota also requires that the MOC include information about Medicare and Medicaid services including MLTSS are communicated from the MLTSS care coordinator to primary care or home health providers how clinical practice guidelines are appropriate for and tailored to differences in frailty levels including for members receiving MLTSS and the measures the DSNP uses that are tailored to the frail elderly including those receiving MLTSS and how these measures account for differences in care delivery models.,Section II  Part C

5855,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8184,In the 2016 Call Letter CMS reminded plans of their obligations under 42 CFR 422.504(g)(1)(iii) to educate network providers about QMB billing rules and to maintain procedures that ensure network providers do not discriminate against enrollees based on their payment status e.g. QMB.  During summer 2016 CMS engaged in strategic conversations with MA organizations to discover their technical assistance needs and learn about concrete strategies to promote compliance. During this process and in followup MA organizations have asked for CMS help to identify the QMB status of enrollees and to recommend promising practices regarding QMB billing.,Section II  Part C
5856,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8185,The QMB Program is a Medicaid benefit that pays Medicare premiums and cost sharing for certain lowincome Medicare beneficiaries.  Federal law prohibits Medicare providers from collecting Medicare Part A and Part B coinsurance copayments and deductibles from those enrolled in the QMB Program including those enrolled in Medicare Advantage and other PartC plans.  Timely access to enrollees QMB status is critical to inform monitor and promote provider compliance with these requirements. In June 2017 CMS informed plans about CMS sources of QMB information including the Medicare Advantage Medicaid Status Data File which provides the most current information about monthly dual status including QMB and corresponding dual status codes. As a reminder for MedicareMedicaid Plans (MMPs) in the capitated model of the Financial Alignment Initiative and for Program of AllInclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) organizations coinsurance copays and deductibles are zero for all Medicare Parts AB services.,Section II  Part C
5857,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8186,To reinforce billing requirements simplify compliance and prevent instances of improper billing CMS encourages plans to affirmatively inform providers about enrollee QMB status and exemption from costsharing liability. Plans can provide realtime QMB status information and indicators through online provider portals and phone query mechanisms and clearly indicate the QMB patient owes 0 directly on the Explanations of Payment document that they send to providers and on member identification cards. MMPs should make clear that all enrollees  regardless of whether they have QMB status or not  have zero Medicare Parts AB coinsurance copayments and deductibles.  In addition plans can highlight that for any providers who are enrolled in Medicare Medicares HETS eligibility query system will identify those who are QMB.,Section II  Part C
5858,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8187,CMS also encourages plans to educate providers about the QMB billing requirements for Medicare Parts AB deductibles and coinsurance.  Potential strategies include holding recurring trainings conducting targeted education to providers that improperly bill members and adding language to providerfocused websites provider newsletters andor provider manuals.,Section II  Part C
5859,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8188,Plans may want to leverage CMS information for providers and plans on CMSs QMB webpage at httpswww.cms.govMedicareMedicaidCoordinationMedicareandMedicaidCoordinationMedicareMedicaidCoordinationOfficeQMB.html,Section II  Part C

CMS must be in receipt of a successfully submitted and validated formulary submission by the deadline of June 4 2018 in order for the formulary to be considered for review. The Part D formulary is part of the plans complete bid and therefore a failure to submit and link a formulary to each plan that uses a formulary by the June 4 deadline will result in denial of that bid submission.,Section III  Part D

5881,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8210,CMS publishes the Formulary Reference File (FRF) which is utilized by Part D sponsors for the purpose of submitting Part D formulary files into HPMS. The FRF is not intended to be a comprehensive list of Part D drugs  the presence on or absence from the FRF does not indicate whether a particular drug is eligible for Part D coverage. However we do recognize that the FRF has expanded and now includes several drugs for which utilization under Part D would be extremely rare. We also understand that the inclusion of some of these drugs within the Medicare Plan Finder may lead to beneficiary confusion when the drug is more commonly covered under Medicare Part B for example. To that end CMS is analyzing the Part D utilization of current FRF drugs and will be removing drugs from the FRF based on these results. We again emphasize that the removal from the FRF does not mean that the drug is not eligible for Part D coverage. The deletion of such drugs would be based on very infrequent utilization under Part D due to their indication dosage and administration and usual administration setting. For example an intravenous antihypertensive with very little or no Part D utilization that is only indicated for the shortterm treatment of hypertension when the oral route is not feasible potentially would be deleted from the FRF.,Section III  Part D
5882,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8211,CMS will release a draft FRF that reflects these changes in February of 2018 and will provide Part D sponsors and other stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the FRF changes. A subsequent CY 2019 Formulary Reference File (FRF) will be published in March 2018. The March FRF release will be used in the production of the OutofPocket Cost (OOPC) model tool scheduled to be released in April 2018 in order to assist plan sponsors in preparing their bid submissions. Sponsors should note that the OOPC model released in April will not be modified to incorporate any subsequent FRF updates as described below.,Section III  Part D
5883,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8212,CMS will update the 2019 FRF in mid to late May prior to the June 4 formulary submission deadline. Since the OOPC model incorporates Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data from 2012 and 2013 new Part D drugs cannot be included in the OOPC model since they would not have appeared in the survey. Further given the limited timeframe between the May release of the 2019 FRF and the June 4 deadline CMS is unable to accommodate an updated version of the 2019 OOPC model to incorporate the new generics that may be added to the May FRF. Therefore CMS cautions plan sponsors that any newly added drugs on the May release of the 2019 FRF will not be included in the 2019 OOPC model.,Section III  Part D
5884,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8213,CMS will offer a summer formulary update window and will publish an update to the FRF in advance of the window. The summer formulary update window will allow for the following formulary changes 1) the addition of drugs that are new to the summer release of the FRF and 2) the submission of negative changes on brand drugs only if an equivalent generic or therapeutically similar drug is added to the summer FRF and corresponding formulary file within the same category and class at the same tier or lower and with no more restrictive utilization management than what was applied to the existing brand. Thus plan sponsors need to carefully consider any newly added drugs to the May release of the 2019 FRF when they submit their formularies by the June 4 deadline since these additional restrictions will be imposed on the summer formulary update window.,Section III  Part D
5885,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8214,In 2017 for the 2018 plan year the update window was held from July 27 to July 31. Since the summer update window is the final opportunity for plan sponsors to remove drugs from their formularies prior to the start of the plan year CMS intends to move this window later into the summer with the goal being the inclusion of newly approved brands and generics that occur in July and into August. We recognize however that Part D sponsors must finalize their formulary submissions for CY 2019 with enough time to meet printing deadlines. We thus seek stakeholder comment regarding the optimal submission window that balances the opportunity for additional formulary substitution versus the need to finalize formulary documents for printing.,Section III  Part D
5886,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8215,Part D sponsors are reminded that they may enhance their formularies at any time including prior to the start of the plan year regardless of whether the new drugs have been added yet to the FRF. Such enhancements may entail adding Part D drugs (with or without utilization management restrictions) reducing beneficiary costsharing or removing utilization management edits. These enhancements must be included in the Part D sponsors marketing materials and must be submitted during the next available HPMS formulary submission window. Under the current formulary submission process HPMS formulary files are not updated between the aforementioned summer update window and the first HPMS submission window during the plan year. Since the HPMS formulary files feed into the Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) MPF formulary information will not reflect any enhancements the Part D sponsor has made to its formulary files after the summer update. In an effort to provide more uptodate information within the MPF CMS will add an enhancementonly window that will occur in late fall.

In an effort to streamline the submission process for Part D sponsors offering a MedicareMedicaid Plan CMS will make the ADD Validation File available via HPMS in advance of the ADD File submission deadline.,Section III  Part D

5892,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8221,The NonExtended Day Supply (NDS) file is a supplemental file for formularies that offer partial extended day supply coverage for at least one tier. Based on feedback from Part D sponsors we understand that the maintenance of this supplemental file has been operationally challenging. Current systems logic has prohibited sponsors from having the flexibility to make some positive enhancements that would otherwise be allowed. Further CMSs review of the CY 2017 NDC files have not identified any discriminatory activities or causes for concerns. We have concluded the burden of maintaining this supplemental file outweighs any benefit as such CMS is eliminating this supplemental file for CY 2019.  PartD Sponsors will continue to identify in the plan benefit package (PBP) if there are any drugs for which the plan imposes a limit of a one month supply if the drugs are included on a tier that is otherwise available at an extended day supply.,Section III  Part D
5893,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8222,OvertheCounter (OTC) Validation File,Section III  Part D
5894,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8223,Part D sponsors wishing to offer overthecounter drug products (OTCs) as part of step therapy or as a utilization management strategy are required to submit an OTC supplemental file. The current file format is National Drug Codes (NDCs) submitted by Part D sponsors. The submitted files are validated against an internal CMS file that contains a universe of OTC NDCs that CMS believes could be offered as part of the sponsors step therapy or utilization management strategy consistent with the Chapter 7 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual. NDCs not contained within the CMS validation file are rejected which necessitates a subsequent submission of a revised file by the Part D sponsor. In an effort to reduce the burden on Part D sponsors to create and submit these files and to streamline the CMS review of the OTC submissions CMS is proposing to provide plans with an OTC reference file for CY 2019 that uses a proxy code (e.g. RXCUI) to represent each unique drug ingredient strength route and dosage form but the file will not contain every possible branded OTC. Providing the file of acceptable OTCs via proxy code in advance to plan sponsors will enable them to prepare their files based on known CMS acceptable OTCs significantly reduce the size of the OTC files and simplify the submission and review process. For example the current OTC validation file contains nearly 100 rows representing various products for ranitidine 75 mg oral tablets. These would be condensed to one row for CY 2019. We will provide Part D sponsors an opportunity to review a draft OTC reference file well in advance of the supplemental file submission deadline.,Section III  Part D

5896,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8225,The definition of a Part D drug does not include overthecounter drug products (OTCs). Therefore Part D sponsors cannot cover OTCs under their basic prescription drug benefit or as a supplemental benefit under enhanced alternative coverage. However given that OTCs may offer a significantly less expensive alternative to prescription medications CMS allows Part D sponsors the option to provide OTCs as a utilization management strategy within their administrative cost structure with the expectation that the use of the OTC medication will offset the use of a more costly Part D drug.,Section III  Part D
5897,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8226,For those sponsors who elect to do so OTCs offered through a Part D utilization management strategy are a component of the Part D plan premium and result in OTCs provided to the enrollee without any direct costsharing at the pointofsale. The OTCs must be available for the full duration of the contract year and cannot be limited to certain benefit phases. Under this policy OTCs do not have the same beneficiary protections such as coverage determinations or temporary fills required to ensure appropriate access to Part D drugs.,Section III  Part D
5898,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8227,Currently no standalone PDPs and only a very few MAPDs offer OTCs under existing Part D policies but there has been plan interest to broaden what could be provided. Consequently CMS is contemplating allowing additional flexibilities for Part D plan sponsors to offer access to OTCs. For example CMS could consider allowing sponsors to include additional OTC products such as dietary supplements and cough medicines without the requirement that the OTC product offset the use of a Part D drug.,Section III  Part D
5899,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8228,We recognize that any such expansion of the current policy could potentially increase program costs. Plan sponsors should note that the beneficiary inducement laws still apply.  We are thus soliciting feedback from stakeholders on Part D OTC enhancements that could be considered for future policy. This feedback could include information on how well the current program is working the deficiencies of the current program what additional flexibilities would be helpful and what the impact would be on spending particulary premiums as a result.,Section III  Part D

Per 42 C.F.R.  423.153(d) for 2012 and subsequent years the annual cost threshold for targeting beneficiaries is specified as costs for covered Part D drugs in an amount greater than or equal to 3000 increased by the annual percentage increase (API) in Part D drug expenditures specified in 42 C.F.R.  423.104(d)(5)(iv). The 2018 MTM program annual cost threshold is 3967.

Specifically pursuant to 423.272(b)(3)(i) CMS will only approve a bid submitted by a Part D sponsor if its plan benefit package (other than defined standard) or plan cost structure is substantially different from those of other plan offerings by the sponsor in the service area with respect to key characteristics such as premiums costsharing formulary structure or benefits offered and pursuant to 42 C.F.R. 423.104(d)(2)(iii) tiered costsharing for nondefined standard benefit designs may not exceed levels annually determined by CMS to be discriminatory. The benefit parameters for CY 2019 are set forth in Table 25 below.,Section III  Part D
5904,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8233,CMS has included a proposal in the CMS4182P Medicare Program Contract Year 2019 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs NPRM published November 28 2017 to eliminate the PDP enhanced alternative (EA) to EA meaningful difference requirement while maintaining the requirement that enhanced plans be meaningfully different from the basic plan offered by a plan sponsor in a service area. We also announced our intent to reexamine how we define the meaningful difference between basic and enhanced plans and sought stakeholder input.  For CY 2019 we intend to follow the same methodology that was utilized to determine the CY 2017 and CY 2018 basic to enhanced meaningful difference threshold. We propose a minimum monthly costsharing outofpocketcosts (OOPC) difference between basic to enhanced PDP offerings of 22. This value is based on the 50th percentile of the November CY 2018 Bid data run through the updated CY 2018 OOPC MPF model that incorporates CY 2018 Formulary Data 201213 MCBS Data and FDA Application Type for applicablenonapplicable determinations related to coverage gap costsharing estimates.

5905,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8234,For purposes of determining whether coverage gap costsharing thresholds specified in Table 25 have been met we will continue to rely on the FDA Application Type to identify formulary drugs as applicable or nonapplicable. The maximum coinsurance of 50 applies to tiers that contain only applicable drugs. If only nonapplicable drugs or a combination of both nonapplicable and applicable drugs are on a tier then the maximum coinsurance of 17 applies. We remind sponsors that when costsharing reductions beyond the standard benefit are offered through a supplemental Part D benefit the plan liability is applied to applicable drugs for applicable beneficiaries before the manufacturer discount.,Section III  Part D

5907,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8236,We will continue to scrutinize the expected costsharing amounts incurred by beneficiaries under coinsurance tiers in order to more consistently compare copay and coinsurance costsharing impacts. If a sponsor submits coinsurance values (instead of copayment values) for its nonspecialty tiers that are greater than the standard benefit of 25 we will compare the average expected costsharing amounts submitted by sponsors in the PBP to the established copay thresholds as noted in Table 25 below to determine whether the coinsurance values are discriminatory. Similarly we will evaluate the drug composition of copay tiers in order to assess whether the formulary and benefit structure is providing a meaningful benefit.,Section III  Part D

5909,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8238,We expect Drug Tier Labels to be representative of the drugs that make up that tier. Sponsors will continue to have the option of selecting a nonpreferred brand tier or nonpreferred drug tier but not both. CMS will continue to evaluate the brandgeneric composition of the nonpreferred brand tier as part of the bid review process. In recent years we have communicated concerns based on an outlier analysis. Based on an analysis of CY 2018 formulary and benefits data we propose a maximum threshold of 25 generic composition for the nonpreferred brand tier for CY 2019. This threshold is based on the mean generic composition submitted at the plan level of the nonpreferred brand tier for CY 2018. Since Part D sponsors have the option to choose between the nonpreferred brand and nonpreferred drug tier labels the inclusion of a significant number of generic drugs on a tier that is labeled as brand is unnecessary and may lead to confusion. While we continue to believe a coinsurance structure is the preferable costsharing structure for the nonpreferred drug tier CMS will continue to afford Part D sponsors the flexibility to determine the costsharing structure that is most appropriate for their benefit design with the goal of maintaining transparency and a meaningful benefit offering for enrollees in a plan with nonpreferred drug tiers that also balances a sponsors ability to mix brand and generic drugs within the tier. We intend to conduct outlier tests for those Part D sponsors who choose a copay structure for the nonpreferred drug tier. In order to demonstrate that the costsharing structure chosen provides a value for beneficiaries we expect sponsors to evaluate and be prepared to provide written justification upon request. We expect the justification to include detailed information about the generic drugs on the nonpreferred drug tier such as expected utilization the formulary alternatives represented on lower tiers and any tier placement strategy with respect to utilization management. Sponsors may be asked to make modifications to their benefit structure or formulary tiering if the submitted justification is not accepted.,Section III  Part D

CMS evaluates plan enrollment at the PDP region level. Consistent with the methodology outlined in the CY 2012 Call Letter plans are deemed as low enrollment plans if both of the following are true 1) the plan enrollment is below 1000 and 2) the plan is in the lowest quintile of enrollment within the specific PDP region. Prior to taking additional action on a low enrollment plan CMS considers relevant factors such as (1) whether the plan is a basic plan that is satisfying requirements set forth at 42 CFR  423.104(f)(2) and the organizations enhanced plan does not have low enrollment in the same region (2) whether the plan was a new plan and if it has been in existence for three or more years (3) whether the plan is offered nationally (4) the total number of plan offerings in the applicable region and (5) if the plans premium currently falls at or below the low income benchmark premium amount. When a plan is deemed to have low enrollment the Part D sponsor will be provided the opportunity to provide a strategic plan that describes how enrollment will be increased for the upcoming plan year. Alternatively the sponsor will have the option to consolidate or nonrenew the plan. However CMS proposes that if the plan is identified as a low enrollment plan for two consecutive years using the above criteria CMS can exercise its authority to nonrenew the plan. By April 2018 we will notify affected low enrollment plans with less than 1000 enrollees of available options for consolidationwithdrawal options.,Section III  Part D

Part D sponsors should identify potential opioid overutilizers and conduct retrospective reviews and case management. This approach can help identify beneficiaries at risk of adverse events due to prescription opioids. These efforts do not include beneficiaries with cancer or in hospice. Under our current policy if sponsors cannot establish medical necessity due to unresponsive prescriber(s) or if misuse is verified with prescribers with the prescribers agreement sponsors may implement a beneficiaryspecific claim edit at all network pharmacies that will result in the rejection of claims or quantities in excess of the opioid dosing deemed medically necessary.,Section III  Part D

This system identifies those beneficiaries we consider at significant risk (high levels of opioids with potential coordination of care issues due to obtaining opioids from multiple prescribers and pharmacies). CMS expects plans to report back to us their results of implementing the review and case management policies through the OMS. Over time CMS has modified the OMS opioid overutilization criteria based on stakeholder feedback and on the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. With regard to the latter the OMS criteria incorporate a 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) threshold cited in the CDC Guideline which was developed by experts as the level that prescribers should generally avoid reaching with their patients. CMS considers plan and provider burden along with beneficiary impact in developing the OMS criteria. We have also continued to modify OMS in other ways as relevant information and guidelines have become available. For example in October 2016 we added a flag to OMS indicating potential opioid overutilizers who have also been prescribed a benzodiazepine which is known to increase risk of overdose when taken together.,Section III  Part D

Gabapentin a gapapentinoid has been identified as an independent risk factor for opioidrelated deaths and is reportedly misused due to the euphoria associated with use at high doses. The increasing use of gabapentin for offlabel indications despite the lack of evidence from clinical trials has been documented in the literature. One such off label indication is nonspecific chronic lower back pain which is on the rise. As the focus on opioid use is intensifying clinicians and patients may be looking for alternatives for their pain treatment. Currently gabapentin is FDAapproved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and the treatment of partial onset seizures.,Section III  Part D

6097,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8471,In 2017 we provided additional guidance to sponsors regarding appropriate use of these edits.  As we stated in the memo through review of complaints received via the CMS Complaint Tracking Module (CTM) during the first months of 2017 discussions with Part D sponsors and receipt of questions from other stakeholders we believed that some sponsors implemented these edits beyond their intended use as a safety edit. For example the edits are not intended as a means to implement a prescribing limit or apply additional clinical criteria for the use of opioids but instead to give physicians important additional information about their patients opioid use. Since that time we have observed few complaints per month in the CTM related to these edits.,Section III  Part D
6098,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8472,Given the public health emergency and the fact that half of sponsors are already implementing hard MME edits sponsors can and should do more to address chronic high prescription opioid overuse. Therefore we propose that all sponsors should implement a hard edit in 2019 that is triggered when a beneficiarys cumulative daily MME reaches or exceeds 90 mg (meaning the MME threshold should only be set at 90 MME). This value aligns with the CDC Guideline which recommends to generally avoid increasing the daily dosage of opioids to 90 MME.,Section III  Part D
6099,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8473,Sponsors should not include multiple prescriber or multiple pharmacy criteria in these edits so that all beneficiaries using 90 MME per day or more regardless of the number of providers are identified. Sponsors should continue to apply specifications to account for known exceptions such as hospice care cancer diagnoses reasonable overlapping dispensing dates for prescription refills or new prescription orders for continuing fills and highdose opioid usage previously determined to be medically necessary such as through coverage determinations prior authorization case management or appeals processes. It is also very important that sponsors implement these edits in a way that beneficiaries access to medicationassisted treatment (MAT) such as buprenorphine is not impacted. Sponsors should not include buprenorphine products in this edit.,Section III  Part D
6100,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8474,To balance beneficiary access to medically necessary drug regimens and reduce the potential for any unintended consequences for patients already on higher doses of opioids such as withdrawal symptoms we propose that sponsors should implement these edits in 2019 to allow beneficiaries to receive a 7 days supply of the prescription that triggered the hard edit as written. This would provide a short term supply to patients to allow time to pursue coverage through the exceptions process. However if the exception request is approved the patient may need to obtain a new prescription from their prescriber for amounts beyond the 7 days supply. Alternatively the patient could elect not to receive the partial 7 days supply fill (e.g. they are not out of the medication) and go through the exceptions process. In that case if approved the original prescription could be filled. Also in the case of opioid prescriptions that trigger the 90 MME hard edit where the packaging is only available in a days supply greater than 7 days we would not expect any supply to be provided. The beneficiary would need to obtain an approved exception in order to get the medication. Nonetheless we are not aware of any State laws or labeling that would prohibit prescription opioids from being dispensed in a smaller quantity.,Section III  Part D
6101,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8475,We additionally propose to only allow the 7 days supply once. That is if the beneficiary attempts to fill a prescription for another opioid that triggers the MME hard edit another 7 days supply would not be allowed. We request comment on this concept and stakeholder feedback on its operational feasibility. Should we finalize a policy whereby the 7 days supply is only available once after the 90 MME hard edit is triggered during a specific time period if a patient presents at the pharmacy with multiple opioid prescriptions on the same day if only one 7 days supply was allowed the pharmacist would help assess the immediate needs of the patient to help determine which prescription should be filled for a 7 days supply. We further seek comment on when and how to best communicate to beneficiaries that the onetime 7 days supply would not be available for future prescriptions should the MME level remain at 90 mg or higher.,Section III  Part D
6102,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8476,To estimate the number of beneficiaries who may be impacted by a cumulative MME edit at 90 MME per day we analyzed 2016 PDE data across all Part D sponsors. In 2016 almost 1.6 million beneficiaries (3.8 of Part D enrollees) met or exceeded 90 MME for at least one day excluding those with cancer in hospice care or with overlapping dispensing dates for timely continued fills for the same opioid (e.g. false positives). We seek feedback on whether all sponsors have the capacity to implement hard edits at 90 MME as well as the 7 days allowance proposal for 2019. We also request comment on other solutions to address prescription opioid overuse while balancing access to medically necessary drug regimens and reducing the potential for unintended consequences.,Section III  Part D
6103,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8477,Furthermore we reiterate that when the MME edit is triggered and cannot be resolved at the pharmacy consistent with Section 40.3.1 of Chapter 18 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual the sponsor is required to notify their network pharmacy to distribute a written copy of the standardized CMS pharmacy notice to the enrollee (Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage and Your Rights CMS10147 OMB Approval No. 09380975). This notice instructs enrollees on how to contact their plan and explains their right to obtain a coverage determination from their plan including information about the exceptions process.,Section III  Part D
6104,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8478,Sponsors are reminded that an enrollee the enrollees representative or the enrollees prescriber has the right to request a coverage determination for a drug or drugs subject to the MME edit including the right to request an expedited coverage determination. The timeframe for expedited coverage determination requests applies when the prescriber indicates or the plan decides that applying the standard timeframe may seriously jeopardize the enrollees life health or ability to regain maximum function. We generally expect coverage determination requests seeking exceptions to the MME edit to meet the criteria for expedited review which means the plan sponsor must issue a decision within 24 hours of receipt of the prescribers supporting statement (attestation).,Section III  Part D
6105,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8479,Consistent with current guidance if the only issue in dispute is the MME CMS expects the Part D sponsor to only rely on prescriber attestation that the higher MME is medically necessary to approve dosing that is higher than the hard edit when a coverage determination is requested. The authorization of the higher MME level should be considered an approved exception and be valid through the remainder of the plan year. The exception should apply to the cumulative MME level for the beneficiary not just one specific drug or one prescriber. In order to minimize unnecessary disruptions in therapy Part D sponsors should consult with the prescriber(s) to determine whether dose escalation for the beneficiary is imminent and authorize an increased MME accordingly. The sponsor should also remove the edit if it is determined that the beneficiary meets their established criteria for known exceptions (such as cancer or hospice).,Section III  Part D
6106,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8480,As outlined in 42 CFR  423.120(b)(7) a Part D sponsor that uses a formulary under its qualified prescription drug coverage must establish policies and procedures to educate and inform health care providers and enrollees concerning its formulary. Accordingly CMS expects sponsors network pharmacies and customer service representatives to be adequately trained with regard to these edits to ensure affected beneficiaries are given timely and appropriate information and instruction. It is important that these edits be implemented in a manner that minimizes disruption to beneficiaries. It is integral that sponsors have the ability to efficiently process associated exceptions and appeals including expedited requests. CMS expects sponsors to ensure that their staff are trained to appropriately identify enrollee requests for a coverage determination including verbal requests made by enrollees affected by hard MME edits. Plans are not permitted to instruct an enrollee who is requesting coverage that only their prescriber can initiate the request.,Section III  Part D
6107,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8481,Part D sponsors will continue to submit information on their cumulative MME safety edits using a template through HPMS. We will monitor implementation of these edits including complaints data. In addition Part D sponsors report implementation outcomes of their MME POS edits such as number of claims rejected due to edits number of beneficiaries impacted and number of rejected claims overridden or processed through the Part D reporting requirements. CMS will analyze these data once reported and validated. The first data collection will be in February 2018 for 2017 reporting requirements data and validated data by September 2018.,Section III  Part D

6109,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8483,The sixth recommendation of the CDC Guideline states that opioids prescribed for acute pain should be limited to three days or fewer and that seven days are rarely necessary. Clinical evidence cited by the CDC review found that opioid use for acute pain is associated with longterm opioid use and that a greater amount of early opioid exposure is associated with greater risk for longterm use. Because the amount of opioid prescribed can often be in excess of the amount needed to treat an acute event leftover supplies of opioids can become the source for misuse and diversion. Limiting the initial amount of prescription opioids dispensed may reduce the risk that patients develop an affinity for these drugs and transition to chronic use or misuse.  Currently at least sixteen States have or plan to add by statute or agency rule days supply (e.g. 5 or 7 days) andor daily dose limits on the initial amount of opioids that clinicians can prescribe for acute pain. In addition several large prescription benefit plans are implementing similar restrictions within their commercial health plan employer and Medicaid clients.,Section III  Part D
6110,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8484,In addition to the strategies described above to help better manage high chronic prescription opioid use CMS intends to establish a days supply limitation policy for opioid nave patients in this years final 2019 Call Letter that balances reducing the harm posed by opioids with an individuals need for access to appropriate pain relief. Ultimately we seek to align our policy with other Government programs. For example the FDA is seeking stakeholder input (82 FR 58572) on how the FDA might under its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) authority improve the safe use of opioid analgesics by curbing overprescribing to decrease the occurrence of new addictions and limit misuse and abuse of opioid analgesics.,Section III  Part D

CMS understands that implementing such restrictions may create important challenges. Any restrictions should not compromise appropriate pain treatment or result in an excessive burden on clinicians and their patients. We request feedback from stakeholders especially Part D sponsors providers and PBMs on the implementation of a days supply limitation at 7 days or if an alternative days supply limit would be more appropriate (such as 3 days or 5 days) including their experience with such limitations or the basis for their recommendations. We also solicit comment on whether a days supply limit with or without a daily dose maximum (e.g. 50 MME per day) would be more effective. In particular we request information on both inclusions and exceptions for specific clinical situations (i.e. whether and to what extent a supply limit could be based on specific indications or other criteria) and other parameters and what safeguards should be in place to protect appropriate beneficiary access.,Section III  Part D

6113,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8487,Both the use of longacting (LA) opioids and the number of opioid prescriptions are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Clinically there is little support for maintaining a patient on multiple different opioids and such use creates other health care issues. First the use of multiple opioids that compete for similar pain receptors may provide little improvement in analgesia while increasing the risk of adverse events. In addition prescriptions for multiple opioids (whether LA or shortacting (SA)) andor multiple strengths increases the supply of opioids available for diversion and abuse as well as the opportunity for selfmedication and dose escalation. Therefore additional DUR controls at the POS like a soft edit may help reduce excess opioid supplies and reduce adverse events.,Section III  Part D
6114,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8488,Beneficiaries who receive multiple LA andor multiple SA opioids may lack coordinated care and be at higher risk of opioid overdose. Some plans and PBMs already implement therapeutic duplication edits that check for opioid prescriptions whose days supply overlap before a certain percent has expired or overlap for a minimum number of days. If the prescription overlap criteria are met the plan sends an alert to a pharmacy at POS. However many of these edits are message only and may not cause a pharmacist to check a patient profile or hisher States PDMP.,Section III  Part D
6115,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8489,As a result of these concerns CMS designed an analysis to investigate duplicate opioid use in Medicare Part D. In this context we defined duplicate or multiple as more than one LA or more than one SA opioid prescription with overlapping days supply. This does not however mean a combination of LA and SA opioids with each other. Duplicate LA use was defined as a second prescription for an LA that occurred before 75 of a prior LA opioids days supply expires. We defined duplicative therapy as fills for different LA opioids unique at the generic entity dosage form and strength. For example methadone 10mg and methadone 5mg tablets would trigger the opioid duplicative edit. We used 2016 prescription drug event (PDE) claims for LA opioids to generate beneficiary counts. For purposes of this analysis LA opioids are defined as oral buccal formulations that can be taken every 8 hours or greater or are transdermal.,Section III  Part D

Next we identified how many of these beneficiaries had duplicative LA opioid therapy meaning fills for different LA opioids at the generic entity dosage form and strength (criteria 3). This yielded over 200000 beneficiaries (15.6). Lastly we recognize that multiple LA opioid prescriptions of different strengths can be clinically appropriate so we examined the impact of requiring different opioid prescribers (criteria 4). Of those beneficiaries with duplicative LA opioid therapy over 66000 (5.1) were from different prescribers.,Section III  Part D

6140,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8519,Based on these findings we expect all Part D plan sponsors to implement a soft POS edit for duplicative LA opioid therapy beginning in 2019 with or without a multiple prescriber criterion. When such an edit is triggered for concurrent use of opioids and buprenorphine the soft edit should only reject the opioid prescription following the buprenorphine claim and should not impede access to buprenorphine for MAT. It is very important that a sponsor should only implement this edit if it has the technical ability to not reject buprenorphine claims.,Section III  Part D

We also seek feedback on how best to manage multiple opioid POS edits that a single prescription may trigger for instance a duplicative therapy and cumulative MME POS edit. In addition we request feedback on extending the specifications in the future to include SA opioids and defining duplicative therapy as previously described for LA opioids (i.e. generic entity dosage form strength andor differing prescribers) or another unique drug classification scheme (e.g. removing strength).

6180,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8559,Previous guidance documents indicate that inhalation drugs administered in a long term care setting where the stay is not covered under Medicare Part A can be covered under Part D.  We are now clarifying how Part D plans can determine that a beneficiary is residing in a long term care facility.,Section III  Part D
6181,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8560,Medicare Part B covers certain inhalation drugs such as Albuterol and Levalbuterol nebulizer solutions as supplies under the DME benefit. The DME benefit however is not available to beneficiaries residing in longterm care facilities (i.e. Nursing Facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities). Consequently if the beneficiary is not on a Part A stay in one of these facilities these inhalation drugs can be covered under Medicare Part D.  While Part D sponsors generally have relied on the prescribers statement that the beneficiary resides in longterm care facility to authorize Part D coverage since 2013 CMS has required sponsors to report the patient residence code on prescription drug events (PDEs). We expect that patient residence codes submitted to CMS are accurate and because they represent a recent dispensing event the residence codes offer a more timely view of patients location than previous information communicated by the prescriber. Therefore CMS permits Part D sponsors to rely on a patient residence code of 3 or 9 on a pharmacy claim for determining when such inhalation drugs may be covered under Part D. Moreover we expect that sponsors will only pay claims for these products when the pharmacy claim includes these specified patient residence codes regardless of any prior coverage determination based upon a prescriber statement indicating that the beneficiary resides in a longterm care facility (i.e. the prescriber statement and patient residence code must be aligned).,Section III  Part D

6183,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8562,In the 2014 Call Letter we stated that Part D sponsors should require their network retail and mailorder pharmacies to obtain patient consent to deliver a new or refill prescription prior to each delivery in an attempt to decrease the waste and unnecessary costs associated with unneeded or unwanted prescriptions. Subsequently we modified this policy to permit exceptions subject to certain conditions that allow Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) mailorder autoship programs that do not obtain patient consent prior to delivery for both new prescriptions and refills. We also modified the policy for all Part D plans with respect to automatic shipments of new prescription orders received directly from the prescriber regardless of whether prior patient consent was received.,Section III  Part D
6184,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8563,Consequently since January 1 2014 Part D sponsors of nonEGWP plans have obtained consent from beneficiaries prior to shipping refills of mailorder prescriptions. We have received requests to further modify or eliminate this policy.  Some stakeholders suggest that the current policy creates an unnecessary burden and interferes with improving medication adherence via automatic refill shipments. However we remain concerned that auto shipments of refills not specifically requested by beneficiaries increase shipments of unnecessary or unwanted prescription refills leading to increased waste and potentially inappropriate drug therapy when a discontinued medication is shipped.,Section III  Part D
6185,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8564,We are therefore interested in any information and data associated with mailorder autoship programs (other than those detailing ontime refills medication possession ratio or proportion of days covered) that indicate actual improved adherence by patients resulting from automatic (not patientinitiated) refills.

The contracts PF Composite Price Accuracy score is the average of the Price Accuracy Score which measures the difference between PDE total cost and PF total cost  and the Claim Percentage Score which measures the share of claims where PDE prices are less than or equal to PF prices.,Section IV  MedicareMedicaid Plans
6251,Office Macros,2019Advance,2019Advance.docx,C:\Users\P6BQ\Desktop\capstone.arthur.pignotti\Office Macros\2019Advance.docx,8635,Once PF unit ingredient costs are assigned the PF ingredient cost is calculated by multiplying the unit costs reported on PF by the quantity listed on the PDE.  The PDE cost (TC) is the sum of the PDE ingredient cost paid and the PDE dispensing fee.  Likewise the PF TC is the sum of the PF ingredient cost and the PF dispensing fee that corresponds to the same pharmacy plan and days of supply as that observed in the PDE.  Each claim is then given a score based on the difference between the PDE TC and the PF TC.  If the PDE TC is lower than the PF TC the claim receives a score equal to zero. In other words contracts are not penalized when pointofsale costs are lower than the advertised costs.  However if the PDE TC is higher than the PF TC then the claim receives a score equal to the difference between the PDE TC and the PF TC.  The contract level PF Price Accuracy Index is the sum of the claim level scores and PDE TC across all PDEs that meet the inclusion criteria divided by the PDE TC for those same claims.,Section IV  MedicareMedicaid Plans

This contract has 4 claims for 4 different NDCs and 4 different pharmacies.  This is an abbreviated example for illustrative purposes only in the actual accuracy index a contract must have 30 claims to be evaluated. From each of the 4 claims the PDE ingredient cost dispensing fee and quantity dispensed are obtained.  Additionally the plan ID days of supply date of service and pharmacy number are collected from each PDE to identify the PF data that had been submitted by the contract and posted on Medicare.gov on the PDE dates of service.  The NDC on the claim is first assigned the appropriate reference NDC based on the brand name generic name strength and dosage form.  Using the reference NDC the following PF data are obtained brandgeneric dispensing fee (as assigned by the pharmacy cost file) and unit cost (as assigned by the Price File corresponding to that pharmacy and days of supply on the date of service).  The PDE cost is the sum of the PDE ingredient cost and dispensing fee.  The PF cost is computed as the quantity dispensed from PDE multiplied by the PF unit cost plus the PF brandgeneric dispensing fee (brand or generic status is assigned based on the NDC) and then rounded to the nearest cent. The last column shows the amount by which the PDE cost is higher than the rounded PF cost.  When the PDE cost is less than the rounded PF cost this value is zero.  The Price Accuracy Index is the sum of the last column plus the sum of PDE costs divided by the sum of PDE cost.  The Claim Percentage Index is the number of rows where the last column is greater than zero divided by the total number of rows.,Section IV  MedicareMedicaid Plans
