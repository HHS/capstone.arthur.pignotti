I am a chronic pain patient diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease with 7 herniated disks in my back and neck. I also have Psoriatic Arthritis and bone spurs on all of the joints throughout my body (bone imaging scan done). I suffer from Fibromyalgia as well, so all of my muscles and tissues are extremely sensitive and the pain is unbearable, especially when rubbing against all of the bone spurs. I have a metal bell that holds my neck together and gives me severe migraines 20 days a month, this also causes allot of pain and often prevents me from standing and walking. I suffer with sadness and anxiety due to pain. I have a torn siatica which makes it difficult to climb stairs or do any strenuous activity. My neck and back hurt so bad it's impossible to get a decent nights sleep. 

I am a Medicare patient and am in the process of getting opioid medications subscribed by my Reumatologist. In the meantime I do take Gabapentin 800MG.

I will rely upon opioid medications in the future to:

* allow increased function so I may retain my independent living and daily chores
* manage my incurable pain from the many different illnesses
* allow increased mobility to be able to independently shop for groceries, attend functions, etc.
* remain as productive as possible on my own

If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day, this will give insurance companies and pharmacies an excuse to stop paying for my necessary prescriptions and/or dispensing them at all.

These proposed regulations are not supported by any reliable science.

If enacted, these policies could:

* force even more doctors away from treating pain for fear of losing their license 
* force more patients onto Disability as they will have increased pain and decreased function
* force more patients onto Medicaid as many will not be able to continue to work and will lose health insurance
* create more demand for emergency room services as patients will not have health insurance for doctor visits
* increase the rate of expensive procedures Medicaid or Medicare will have to pay for
* increase the rate of suicides as many patients will not be able to tolerate their pain without their prescribed

"9","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient with the following illnesses: fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraines, IBS, asthma, TMJ/TMD, major depressive disorder, bi-polar, anxiety, MCS, nerve pain from unknown origin. My Internist and I have been together for 20 years now trying to manage the above illnesses. Per his prescriptions, I use tramadol 50mg per day, gabapentin 2400mg per day/evening, cyclobenzaprine 10mg per day, and 1000mg naproxen throughout AM/PM. Along with everything else I am or tried almost all anti-depressants, PT, OT, injections, acupuncture, TENS, creams, biofeedback, and CBT/mindfulness.
My concern is that if any of the tramadol or muscle relaxer taken away it will have an effect on the way I can function and cope. It is very difficult for me with all the above illnesses and I do not want the CMS to enforce opioid doses per day as then the insurance companies and those distributing them will follow.
Just this past summer, I wanted to commit suicide. My Doctor did want me to go to ER for help and I declined to go. The CFS was over-the-top and I felt I need to protect myself from expensive, ineffective or no treatments in the ER. My medical care team is very conservative in their prescribing of opioids.
My cry to you is to FIRST find medications to replace what you are taking away and SECOND go after those illegal drugs in America.

I agree with cancer and hospice exceptions.  I follow a number of non-cancer patients with a life-limiting illness (< 1yr prognosis, not eligible for hospice) who require higher dose opioids.   Setting 7 day limits for these patients would result in fragmented patient care.  I would consider changing the language to include patients with life-limiting illness or those followed by a board-certified palliative care or pain specialist.

I also worry about regulations penalizing the prescribing of non-opioids such as gabapentin or pregabalin.  CMS should encourage non-opioid prescriptions for all patients with chronic pain.  

I agree that more should be done to curb the real opioid crisis in this country.  I worry that these regulations will ultimately make it harder for cancer patients, palliative care patients and hospice patients to access appropriate opioids at the end of life.

"17","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been a Medicare patient for nearly 25 years, due to multiple injuries sustained after being hit by a truck and a slip and fall.  I have been diagnosed with Syringomyelia, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Cluster Headaches, multiple damaged discs, tailbone injury, sciatica and more.  For over a decade I refused to take daily pain medications, as I was concerned about tolerance and they didn't help that much, so I suffered terribly.  I tried nsaids, triptylines, anti epileptics, to no relief.  I tried for over a decade to get better by going through rounds of  PT, OT, Aqua therapy, chiropractic, osteopathic, TENs, MENs, acupuncture, acupressure, mindfulness, medical cannabis, natural remedies, compounds and even a failed pain pump - nothing helped relieve my pain or improve my function.  After being paralyzed and home bound for a year, my doctor suggest the Fentanyl pain patch, and it was miraculous - I went from wheelchair to walker to cane in two months!!  There was no nausea, no fog, no side effects and left me with a very clear head.

Jump forward to WA state's new laws, which started tapering me drastically.  As each micro-gram decreased, so did our lives.  My special needs son wondered why mommy no longer chaperoned field trips, took him to movies or on trips?  This summer I found out about the CDC debacle and was completely shocked that some of the University WA doctors who had gas-lighted our legislature had done their misdeeds at the CDC.  These guidelines were created in secret, by non pain management addiction doctors who had much to gain professionally and financially.  They set arbitrary limits, not taking into consideration genetics (hyper-metabolizing), patient size, disease, disorder or injury.  The 'science' they used is unproven and and frankly, somewhat ridiculous.

If these 'one size fits all' policies are enacted it is likely I may never leave my house again.  I don't know if I could physically or mentally handle more pain than I am already in?  There's no one to care for my special needs son.  If you set caps, so many will die from strokes, heart attacks and suicide.  There'll be more demand at ERs, in  nursing homes and for home care, which will end up costing more.  By under treating pain, it is likely that MORE chronic and intractable pain will be created.  By limiting acute pain medications to a 7 day (or less) supply, you are costing patients more money and additional pain to have to get to their doctor's offices and pharmacies in less than a week after a surgery or injury.
I see many pain patients who have been yanked off their psychiatric medications, because of the FDA Black Box warning.  They are having to choose between panic attacks or pain, or anxiety and pain, or seizures and pain - that is no way to live.  Restricting Lyrica and Gabapentin will only increase MORE pain and disability, as well.  Over 95% of pain patients, according to the CDC, do NOT abuse their medications - they take them as directed and do not divert, as pain patients WANT to improve function and get back to their lives.  Most of us are on strict pain contracts with pill counts, random unrinalysis, and using one pharmacy.

Prescribing has been drastically dropping for over five years, 44% here in WA state since 2012, though overdoses and death due to illicity heroin/Fentanyl(s) are skyrocketing.  The 'Opioid Epidemic' is an illicit drug issue, not a prescribing issue.  We need a legacy exemption for those of us stable on dosages over 90 MME.  We need a national PMP to reduce doctor shopping, if that even occurs anymore?  We need genetic testing, to see who are hyper-metabolizers, so they can get the dosages that work for their unique systems.  We need an intractable pain diagnostic code that will pay doctors a higher fee to manage our complicated and complex cases.  We need protections for our trusted doctors, so that they can prescribe what is necessary to our individual diseases and conditions without fear.
If you set limitations and restrictions many of us will suffer and die.  You must look at real science and not listen to zealots who have created a hysteria for profit.

"19","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My heart goes out to both type of opioid users:  those who need prescribed opioids to have some quality of life and those who become addicted.  But it is very important to keep the two groups separate!

People who suffer from severe, chronic pain and take opioids prescribed by one physician and used them as prescribed.  These people have already tried (I am among this group of people) just about everything available to them to help them enjoy their lives to some degree.  They have tried a variety of prescribed medications, physical therapy, biofeedback, counseling, acupuncture, dry needling, yoga, Botox, healthy eating, and I could go on ad nauseum with no success.  

I have suffered from chronic, severe migraines since I was pregnant with my son who is now 40.  Now in addition to the migraines, I suffer from spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease.  I have raised 4 children, took care of my aging parents, worked full time, enjoyed numerous hobbies and outings with friends - all because I used opioids as prescribed by one doctor, at one pharmacy and was have not had one alcoholic drink since using opioids.  I always consult with my doctor and  pharmacist before even trying an otc drug or a supplement of any kind.

I LOVE MY FAMILY AND MY LIFE, because my pain is somewhat controlled with the opioids I use.

The second group of people using opioids, are not taking them for pain!  They are using them for a high.  They do not use their opioids as prescribed to them by one doctor at one pharmacy but seek anything that will give them a high.  Most of the overdoses we hear about are a result of street drugs and/or mixing alcohol with the drugs they take.  This group of people need to be EDUCATED, provided with treatment for addiction but ultimately, they must assume some personal responsibility for what they put into their bodies.  This group of people frequently have a tremendous risk of dying because they do not use the opioids as prescribed or turn to street drugs,

The first group of people, severe and chronic pain sufferers think of dying as an alternative to living with PAIN all day, every day.  

I know, since I belong to this first group of people.  I live in constant fear that my meds will not be available to me because of the new drug laws and I will have to live in almost constant, unbearable PAIN!  I started Botox injections for my migraines over a year ago and find that the Botox has helped with the severity of the pain on many occasions but it does not eliminate pain.

I fear PAIN MORE THAN ANYTHING!  When it encompasses me and I have nothing to relieve it, I don't want to see my family, especially my cherished grandchildren, i can't enjoy any of the hobbies that used to provide so much happiness for me and I sure cannot even make plans to do something socially with friends or family.  I just curl up in PAIN. If I have to live in PAIN, I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE. There is no point to it except suffering.

So, while I truly understand the need to educate and help those who suffer from addiction, I don't see how depriving me of some quality of life will in any way help those who abuse the opioids for a high!

How many of you enjoy a beer or a glass of wine, now and then?  Should all beverages containing alcohol stop being sold anywhere because of the numerous alcoholics who tear their families apart, lose their jobs and ultimately wreck their bodies.

How about those of you who enjoy going to a casino now and then?  Should all casinos be closed because of those addicted to gambling, which destroys them and their families?

Well, what about food?  We all enjoy not only eating but need to eat to survive!  Well should all food be monitored by politicians and physicians since we are currently dealing with an epidemic of obesity?

Yes, we must educate people before they start using opioids  and provide help to those who are already addicted but should we destroy the lives of those in severe chronic pain, who follow all the rules to stop people from overdosing?  Those that seek a high won't stop with opioids, they will turn to street drugs, sniffing glue, drinking things never meant to be injested.  

Meantime, the rule followers who suffer from severe chronic PAIN, will hope to die if they cannot get some relief for their PAIN!

"20","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"The CDC guidelines, though not mandatory, has caused chaos among doctors and patients.  I'm so frustrated because my rights to have proper medical treatment so I can have any type of quality of life has been taken away from me and millions like me.  Now Medicare is thinking of putting a mandatory cap of my MME per day which will surely give me a life of hell in bed.  I know I will never be able to work again, but I would like to someday walk or move my head without excruciating pain. Because we have to wait until the last day of our medication, if it is on a weekend, we can not get a pre-approval because our doctor's offices are closed and they will not get the fax for pre-approval.  This happened to me when Medicare forced me into a withdrawal because of the pre-approval process because it can take up to 72 hours. In 2019, if Medicare puts a mandatory maximum MME allowed, you are saying every patient's pain is the same, when indeed, each patient is an individual and therefore, each patient's pain is individual. I have been permanently disabled since 2007 and on Medicare since 2009.  I have lived with chronic pain since 1996 living with Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease at the age of 35, I was fully disabled at 45 years of age after my third of five spine surgeries. Between years 2007-2018 my body has developed DDD, Facet Atrophy, stenosis and several other forms of spinal deformities from C3-S1, Fibro Myalgia, Late Stage Lyme Disease, severe Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Osteoporosis, bi-latteral radiculopathy in my arms and legs, curvature of my thoracic and lumbar spines that will worsen as I get older, severe sciatic joint and nerve damage. These diseases have aged my bones 20 years above my current biological age of 56 and my DDD has become so aggressive that 80% of my spine and joints are now damaged as a result of these diseases.  I've endured over 30 failed, non-invasive and invasive procedures and surgeries dealing with Facet Blocks, Nerve Abulation, Nerve Blocks, epidurals and spinal cord stimulators and 21 years of physical therapy's for my neck, shoulders, arms, lumbar, legs and ankles but to no avail to fix my physical abnormalities.  Opioid medications began on December 31, 2006 to the present time with gradual increases over the first 4 years. I was once a strong woman that is now an empty shell filled with pain.  I can no longer care for my home and can barely care for myself  Many days I need help getting dressed or undressed and getting in and out of the shower.  Most days I cannot turn my head or move my legs enough to allow me to drive.  In 2006, I was taking 160 MME every day and by 2008 I was on 260 MME as pain and tolerance increased. In 2014, my PM doctor cut my medications to 105 MME a day.  I don't sleep or walk well. I cannot turn my head more than 20 degrees because of RA, fusions, herniated discs, bone spurs, muscles spasms, RA swelling in every joint, and OA in my spine is so painful I have very little, if any, quality of life.  In 2014 I began seeing a new PM doctor.  He has done everything he can to try and keep my pain under control.  We began with more failed procedures.  He decided my medication levels were too low to give me any pain relief and changed my dosage back to 220 MME a day. In 2016, the new CDC guidelines changed everything and I am now on 180 MME/day which is still not enough to allow me to do the things I would like to do.  I have never failed the random drug tests.  Severe chronic illnesses such as Lyme Disease, MS, CRPS, RA, OA, Osteoporosis, internal organ pain, or any other type of pain causing disease affects each person as an individual just as our medications should be tailored to the individual.  The amount of pain medication for a 250 lb. person may be much higher or even lower than a 100 pound person, dependent upon severity of the illness, so why treat our medication process the same.  ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.  My medications are lowered to a point that makes my life to have no quality.  If Medicare mandates to lower the MME any lower on me, I will not be able to bare the pain and will become another statistic of this ""Epidemic.""  Death would likely treat me better than life in a body I have no control over.  I do hope that you decide against changing any more policies when it comes to MME for anyone because it would do such an injustice and cause more casualties.  Just one of many, many more suicides that are currently happening because of patients' medications being lowered or taken away completely.  What will happen should your 2019 Methodological Changes take place?  The number of suicides which are up over 20 per day from pain patients, will quadruple at lightning speed.    Please do not make my life more miserable than it already is by making mandatory limits of dosage for pain medications and ease up on the Pre-Approval Process as that too is a living nightmare that forces withdrawal and, possibly death.

These proposals are not feasible for the patient or the practitioner, this will also drive costs as patients will be required to be seen more and the pharmacies will have to increase staff to meet the demands every week as many situations will require longer than 7 days to heal. If a patient just has surgery and isn't supposed to sit for x days how will they get their prescription? They will be required to trust someone else to get it, which is where part of the problem lies. With addicts who steal from legitimate patients. Patients who need medication do all they can to protect them, their life depends on it. Why are we not looking at the issues at hand, the addicts, the ones who Dr. Shop, enforce using the state's drug registry, enforce UA before a px is given if not already on a protocol with physician. The prescriptions given at the er for the frequent flyers are the ones that may slightly be contributing to the problem. I work with intractable pain patients daily and can guarantee this is not the answer. The sanctity of the physicians oath and the doctor patient relationship needs to be restored. Take a good look at the toxicology reports from the state's overdoses, you will find there is no opiate epidemic and the ones that have 7 mental health meds on board with tramadol should probably be ruled as a suicide not an opiate related overdose. The numbers are being skewed to fit the agenda and good people are dying because of it. People who want to live.

"22","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As a patient at a pain management practice, there are already so many difficulties and inconveniences involved with opioid treatment. I am 29 years old, and unfortunately I suffer from severe migraine headaches and neck and back problems. At their worst, I would get at least 2 migraines a week, of such severity I couldn't even get out of bed. After many years of treatment through the help of my doctors, I have gotten that figure down to around 2-3 migraines a month. But without the opioid medications I was prescribed, I don't think that vast improvement would have been possible. After having many doctors tell me I was ""too young"" to be experiencing that level of pain, but would never perform an examination, on one occasion, I remember literally begging a doctor to feel, or even just to look to see the knots in my neck and back the size of golfballs. Thankfully, I did find a doctor that took me seriously and after multiple visits, exams, imaging (X-ray, MRIs) and combinations of OTC and weaker prescription analgesics, muscle relaxants and PT, he referred me to pain management. I was blessed again to see a very hands on type doctor, and listed almost all the symptoms I was suffering from just by feeling where the muscle spasms were and asking questions. I was put on prescription pain killers, and that period involved careful titration and trial and error to see which medications worked best for me. After being put on the right combination of meds, I was able to start doing things again, simple things that I used to take for granted. It allowed me to begin doing yoga and certain stretches and exercises that helped alleviate more pain. I have been able to get parts of my life back because of the combination of medication and exercise. I have still had to give up many activities I love, but because of these medications I've gotten some of my life back. I can go out and do things. The uncertainty of your pain level on a day to day basis is very hard to deal with, you stop making plans, and your friends stop calling to ask you to do things with them because you've had to cancel at the last minute so many times. People that are on higher dosages of opioids are on higher dosages because they've been on them for a long time and they do not have the same effect as on people being treated for acute pain. Those of us that need these meds do NOT like to be on them.. it's not fun for us. They are a tether. To use an analogy, do you think diabetics enjoy taking their insulin? Of course not, it's ridiculous, and for long term opioid patients, their pain medicine doesn't make them ""high"" or ""loopy"", it allows us to feel semi-normal. For a bureaucracy to intrude and tell a patient their dose is ""too high"" based on some arbitrary guideline is appalling. Who is more likely to know what the patient needs than their own doctor, who has seen them for a long period of time and can monitor their progress closely. The only result of ""regulations"" like these are negative. Costs go up, doctors spend more time filling out paperwork than looking after the welfare of their patients, and patients suffer. Concern for overdose deaths and opioid abuse are serious issues no one can dispute. But no one obtaining their medication legally would be on higher than 90 MME unless their physician is confident that they need it. Adding more red tape for legitimate pain patients, not just those that suffer from cancer or under the care of hospice, will not solve any problems regarding prescription abuse. They are separate issues, apples and oranges, there is no corollary, as long term, chronic pain sufferers MUST consent to random drug tests, mandatory doctor visits and pill counts. The safeguards are in place. Most overdoses and opioid deaths come from drugs obtained illegally, whether they are prescription opioids sold on the street or from heroin.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0635","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-VA"

Part D Opioid Overutilization Policy:  In regards to the implementation of the opioid hard edit, additional clarification is needed on whether the one-time 7 day supply will replace the transition fill for these drugs and if the MME hard edit should be implemented along with standard quantity limits.  Gateway would like CMS to clarify if a 7 day limit can be provided for each opioid if a patient presents at the pharmacy with multiple opioid prescriptions.  Gateway would also like clarification to determine if the hard edit is going to be strictly considered an exception request and therefore will it need to be approved either until the end of the plan year or for 1 year, or if CMS will consider a shorter duration of approval. 

One of our concerns is that if all opioid requests are considered expedited, there will most likely be a large number of requests that will be denied because information is not received from the physician within the 24 hour timeframe. Additionally, we would like clarification to ensure hospice and cancer patients be excluded from this edit. 

Using the Best Available Information when making B vs D Coverage Determinations:  Gateway agrees that this additional guidance will help with decreasing the burden associated with outreach to determine the transplant payer.  We are asking for clarification around whether coverage can default to Part D if information cannot be determined within the turnaround time. For immuno-suppressants, if the transplant information is not found in the TRR, and coverage is assumed to be under Part D, CMS should clarify if plans are required to outreach to the prescriber for a diagnosis to verify if it is being used for a non-transplant diagnosis that may be compendia supported.

What we are now faced with ""Extreme Indifference and Disregard to human life."" This ""proposal"" of cutting all Medicare Part D recipients who are on opiate medications down to 90 mg MME Morphine equivalency is discriminatory, and unconstitutional at best. It appears that the governments way of dealing with the ""Opiate Crisis"" is to quite literally take down our vulnerable senior citizen's and disabled people of our communities, the people who if any.. have a legitimate reason to be on opiate medication's as these are the people with the greatest health challenges and a great deal of complex pain issues which is why the Medicare Part D program may have the most patients on opiate medications. Not because the Medicare Part D program is overrun with a bunch of opiate user's, and abusers but because these are the patient's who are at the ""greatest need"" if you will to have these medication's. These are also the same legitimate patient's who are at the ""greatest need and justification"" to have opiate daily dosing greater than 90 mg MME Morphine equivalency. This is why I am in such shock, and utter disbelief that the CMS, and Medicare Program is out of all insurer's the ones that are trying to implement such a disastrous egregious policy such as this regarding opiate medication. Are these the people responsible for the opiate epidemic? Are these the people that are out flooding the streets with opiates. No, half cannot even walk, drive, or care for themselves yet supposedly they are the ones out on the black market swindling their opiate medications. Give me a break. It is very apparent to me, and many others I have spoken with that this new proposal by CMS & Medicare is the governments way of outwardly trying to ""deal"" with the opiate crisis by using the only program under which they have immediate control over. However, It is not the Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have fueled the current opiate overdose deaths. It is the flood of illegal, and illicit Fentanyl into the communities from black market dealers. These are the one's the government should be going after and shutting down. Not the Legitimate pain patients in Medicare Part D drug programs. This is absolute insanity. You are going after the wrong people, and the wrong program. Forcing CDC ""Voluntary Guidelines"" into a mandate for all Medicare Part D recipients is not going to combat opiate overdose deaths. It is only going to severely hurt, and push these vulnerable people into utter despair, and outright desperation who need to have continued access to this particular class of medication's without stringent dose restriction's, and unrealistic supply limitations. What you are trying to create here is going to be a disaster. It will cause physician's to turn their back's to these patient's simply because of all the extra paperwork, and pharmacy complication's, and limitation's causing no one to want to treat them at all. It will force hundred's of thousands of these patient's into dangerous withdrawals. What is the recourse for the patient's when this happens? These people are going to be turned away at the pharmacy's due to the ""hard edits"" leaving them without their medications. You cannot just force these people off of this kind of medication without dire consequences, and for some your also dealing with dangerous medical implication's if they are forced to withdrawal. I would recommend to these patient's to get out of the Medicare Part D drug programs and find a Private Rx drug insurer to be able to continue to receive their medication's without these strict limits. However, financially for many, many of these patients having to drop out of the Medicare Part D Rx program's is going to be a huge financial hardship. These people are already paying for their Medicare Part D Rx plan subsidiary. So to have to face challenges such as these for medications that are medically appropriate and that they need is so wrong. This is not a free program and I doubt that many patient's who need opiate prescriptions will want to remain under their Part D plans if this proposal is taken into effect. This is so disheartening. This is the last thing these patient's need to have to go through. I have seen so many suicides due to the stringent unrealistic regulations that are being imposed and forced upon these people. There is just no end in sight to this. Put them all in one box and treat them all the same approach in medicine does not work. We know this. Yet we are continually being faced with these challenges.This class of medications work for pain very well, yet we know if stopped abruptly the patient's will go through a very, very painful, very severe both physical, and psychological often unbearable process of withdrawal. This is inhumane medical negligence to these patient's. We are being told to turn a blind eye too it basically.

Without opiate pain medication, I am in so much pain that I cannot perform simple, satisfying activities of daily living, such shopping, light housekeeping, and helping my husband with such chores as caring for our dog and and making dinner.  

With increasing pressure to take as little medication as possible, I limit myself to the bare minimum opiate doses needed to function at all.  Many days, I am unable to do much more than shower, dress, and sit or lie down and read.  I am in significant and, unfortunately, constant pain.  

Other days, I take a little more medication, and am able to attend the occasional social function:  for example, yesterday, I took additional pain medication in order to attend the calling hours and funeral of a close family friend.  

Until recently, I took more medication, and was able to function better.  However, I can see the pressure my rheumatologist is under to limit the prescription of narcotics, and I do not want to cause problems for her.  This makes me sad, because I am in constant pain and my mobility and quality of life are severely affected.  A couple of days ago, I broke down in tears because I was so in so much pain, yet so conflicted about taking more medication; sometimes, I feel quite downhearted about it.

I have never been remotely tempted to take more medication than I need for pain.  I do not get ""high"" from opiate medication.  I  do get significant pain relief, with modest amounts of medication.

I also utilize other treatment modalities--physical therapy, gabapentin, antidepressant medication, cortisone shots and epidural steroid injections, topical NSAIDS and lidocaine patches.  Unfortunately, due to a history of bleeding ulcers after long-term use of NSAIDS and Celebrex, I can no longer take these.

As noted above, for several years, I did take more opioid medication, and my life was so much more livable.  I could not have worked the last few years of my career without this medication, and after my health forced me to retire, I was still able to live in reasonable comfort, to exercise and ""keep house.""  It makes me sad that pain is now preventing me from living a good quality of life.

Since the ""opioid crisis"" has created such pressure on doctors now, however, I have weaned myself down to quite a low dose.  
Please consider patients like me in developing these rules.  It is not patients like me who are abusing drugs, but patients like me will genuinely and seriously suffer if we cannot get access to medication.

"37","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Dear Medicare/Medicaid President,

I urge you to read about my need for pain medication before making a decision to limit the 90mme per day.  I will suffer, I will suffer needlessly, I will feel that my Country has let me down by taking away my basic human right, to get relief from intractable pain. My freedom to seek medical attention without my doctor causing me harm because he can't write a prescription to treat me and my level of pain due to the government telling him how to be a doctor.

I will be a future Medicare/Medicaid patient.

I am a pain patient diagnosed with Cauda Equine Syndrome for 3 years. I tried - ln-saids, Tricyclic anti-depressants, SSRIs, SNRIs, Steroids, anti-epileptics, etc.  BEFORE opioids I've tried all the different therapies/treatment/surgeries (i.e., PT, OT, Aqua T, Chiro, Osteo, injections, devices, procedures, CBT/mindfulness, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, biofeedback, Medical Cannabis, creams, TENs, MENS, natural remedies, etc) but they all failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and be able to raise my children.  I function because opioids help me live like;- minimal chores, teenagers, grandchildren, travel, entertainment, etc.  

 If Medicare/Medicaid/private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME, I will  not be able to care for myself, my kids, manage my household or have any life besides laying in bed, hoping my pain will kill me.

 It is unlikely my condition will improve and the effects of time and aging will make things worse. Opioids and pain management are my last resort option, to function in society.

Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.

These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.

Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.

 I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.

My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.

A 7 day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.

 A 7 day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.

Thank you,

"40","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am writing as both a pain patient and a scholar working in the area of ethics and policy issues raised by the opioid epidemic. 

If I understand the proposal correctly, the changes suggested in this document would have a terrible impact on at least two groups of people: 1, the sub-population of patients for whom opioid therapy is an appropriate treatment for chronic pain; and 2, legacy patients, some of whom are on many hundreds mg morphine equivalents. 

Proposals like the ones being suggested lead physicians to abandon high-dose patients or forcibly taper them. As a pain patient who has experienced the agony of withdrawal first hand, I want to make clear that forcible tapers are cruel and inhumane. In only a month of withdrawal, I eventually began contemplating suicide. As has been documented in the media, those in worse situations than mine have gone on to succeed in their suicide attempts. 

Although legacy patients who face forcible tapers are likely the most vulnerable to be considered, it's important to realize, also, that some patients do well on chronic opioid therapy. However, the mechanism of tolerance entails that many of these patients end up on fairly high doses. Yes, this is sub-optimal, but when the alternative is life-limiting, terrible pain, it may be justified. 

In short: ham-fisted policy changes like dose limits have the potential to cause significant harm. Add to that the fact that there is no evidence base to support the idea that they also generate benefit, and such policies begin to look very hard to justify. Pain medicine, like all medicine, must be patient-centered, and this policy is the opposite. 

I urge you to reconsider unnuanced opioid prescribing limits. If you would like to discuss any of these comments further, please feel free to contact me at the email address below.

This is a mistaken plan based on the assumption that all patients are the same. We are not. My wife for example, post knee replacement was given morphine. It gave her absolutely no relief. She was give percoset and it did the job. I, for the same surgery, did fine with morphine. That alone shows that you can't write one rule for all patients. In addition, you are proposing this rule based on a faulty assumption, that all pain patients are in danger of overdosing. You need to let physicians who have regular contact with the patient decide what the dosage and risk of addiction is. Most patients are like me. I have a very rigid dosing schedule. I have been on the dosage I take for over 5 years and is is above the proposed ""standard"" yet I am not an addict. An addict will do anything to get high. I have not ever gotten high from the dosage I take. I do not get enough to remove the pain. I get enough to allow me some function. While I can't work I can do some housework and a few other life functions. Reduction in my medication would result in my being unable to leave my bed. I would go from having some sort of life, being able to get out and go to church, see my grandchildren and enjoy what function  I have left to no life worth living. I would propose that enacting this reduction on dosage will cause a spate of suicides as has already stared to occur in states mandating a similar reduction. This reduction does nothing to protect the public health and does nothing but make a few politicians look like they are being proactive on a non existent emergency. If a reduction in overdoses is the desired outcome we need to stop looking at drug abuse as a legal problem requiring enforcement and start treating it as an health issue requiring treatment. We as a nation are slow to learn from history. We tried prohibition in the early part of the 20th century. It did not work then and it doesn't work today with drugs. It is time to stop punishing pain patients for needing medication. We do not tell diabetics they should all take the same amount of insulin. Why do we tell pain patients they have to do without the medications that allow them to function because a SMALL percentage of patients abuse their medication, or because they are being grouped with people who are buying their drugs on the street, not even knowing the dose they are taking?

We deal with people in pain every day. We assess patients holistically. We manage factors that lower the pain threshold. We assess opioid responsiveness. We use multimodal analgesia to limit opioid use. We titrate carefully and reassess frequently. But we teach that there is no upper limit to the dose of opioid analgesia - provided there is clear need, clear benefit and a lack of adverse effects then it is appropriate to adjust the dose upward. We reassure patients and their families that we will do all we can to alleviate distress. We are already restricted by Medicare administrators adhering to rules who have the power to overrule an experienced clinician's judgement regarding the need of a patient for pain relief. Passing this policy in relation to palliative care will undoubtedly and frequently directly result in leaving patients in unnecessary distress, and yes, many will resort to illegal drug use to achieve comfort. We do not have the perfect analgesic, but we have come a long way in understanding pain management (https://theconversation.com/no-most-people-arent-in-severe-pain-when-they-die-86835). Do not undo all the good that has been achieved. Despite our best efforts, there are still a small number of patients who die with significant pain. Don't make this the majority.

I am extremely concerned with the government making opioid laws when they are not doctors and reducing or limiting opioids hurts real pain patients.  There is nothing left for me to have any quality of life living in pain.  I have over 15 different pain conditions and several our rare.  

One condition is over 100 years old and without the #nationalpainstrategy the government will have more suicides on their hands.  Some of the overdose deaths are not due to accidents but as a way to end the pain we live in every second of every day.  We have human rights to be treated for our pain.  We need to give the pain community hope.  You need better death reporting because lumping all deaths linked to opioids as overdose doesn't tell the truth. Some are from under treated pain/suicide.

Just one of my conditions CRPS complex regional pain syndrome is ranked 42 out of 50 on the McGill Pain Scale.  It ranks higher than childbirth, amputation and non terminal cancer.  So when we only allow opioids for cancer patients you are saying our pain doesn't matter and it does.
The government continues to limit dosages and quantities without being educated on all the different pain conditions.  We have children suffering in pain because laws are being passed to restrict opiods from children.  What if your child was in 42/50 pain and someone said well you don't have cancer?
The drug war needs to be better focused on the illegal street drugs.  When a real pain patients is in real pain they take their medications to ease the pain not take it away and we take them responsibly.  
We understand addiction is a huge problem but please talk to those in our pain community that deal with both in their families to get a perspective.  My quality of life should not be taken away because someone became addicted.  We don't take away alcohol or cigarettes which kill but for other forms of addictions like gambling and shopping we send them for treatment.  I am all for treatments for addiction.  Make the insurance companies cover treatments just like they should cover experimental treatments of rare diseases.  Why should I suffer because I have 8 yes 8 rare diseases.  Please just let my trained doctor be my doctor.  Do not allow the government to dictate my healthcare for which they are not trained!

1) we have more people in the country
2) we only started treating chronic pain in the early 2000s
3) Iraq war (a low of vets came back in pain)
4) Afghanistan was (lots of vets in pain- I know one guy who has shrapnel from an IED in his spine that the surgeons refuse to touch, he can still walk, but needs very high doses of opioids to still function)
5) 9/11 (First responders and civilians were harmed)- I'll admit this category isn't huge
6) we under treat acute pain, leading to more long term pain (we don't even treat post-op pain anymore)

The decision about opioids should always be on the patient (and, to a lesser extent, the practitioner). They are the ones who have to live with the results. They are also the ones who have to live in pain.

I've been under a doctors care since 2004 and have been on SSDI since 2010. In my quest for pain relief, I've been prescribed over 20 different types of medications, over 10 different types of pain relieving modalities and have even gone to the such lengths of having weight reduction surgery to reduce my pain levels.
I have done everything requested of me. I have improved my health to the point I no longer now need diabetes medication, my high blood pressure medication and cholesterol medication has been reduced. This has all been possible because I am now ambulatory, can drive short distances and attend exercise class. This allows me to have some sort of semblance of normalcy.
I can still only sit in one place for no longer than 30 mins, or stand longer than 30 mins and certain movements will flare my whole body, but I understand I will never, ever be pain free and I can accept that. I also understand, that it will always take me 2 days to do a load of laundry and a week to complete shopping for household supplies. I know I will never be as active as I once was in the past, BUT being prescribed an opiate for pain has allowed me to live independently without needing to go into an assisted living facility at the age of 55. I feel I worked hard and paid into a system that was and IS suppose to be there to support me, not turn its back on me.
If my pain medication is taken away, all the other numbers are going to start creeping back up because there is no way a persons diabetes remains under control without some type of exercise. In looking at the numbers and how CMS claims to be spending for prescription opioids, they spend just as much money for Diabetes drugs like Januvia, Lanus insulin and Crestor heart medication. I would much rather continue on a medication, which I have been stable on for the past 5+ years, with no increases, then risk increasing my chances of Stroke, Heart Attack or Diabetes. 
I found it very, very offensive when listening not only to the Senate subcommittee hearings on January 17, but the Senate Committee on Homeland Security entitled ""Unintended Consequenses."" I was appalled at Sen. Johnson insinuating that those on Medicaid/Disability automatically = individuals who divert and sell their medication because they only have to pay $3 per perscription. I have never been so boiling mad as not only am I mandated to pay $104, but required to pay $147 for my Medicare Advantage plan and then fork over an additional $200 for my medication per month. And lets not forget the physician co-pays and physical therapy co-pays. When the first speaker came on, Mr. Adolphsen, who continued to bemoan about how he sits at his desk and looks at the data in front of him and how much CMS shells out for prescription opioids, I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one that knows how to fix that. That is a simple one--Congress needs to lift the ban on government price bargaining that has gone on for the past 13 years. The general public supports reduced prescription prices for Medicare Part D prescriptions but for some strange reason, every time it gets brought up, it NEVER makes it out of committee. Wonder why that is? 
Just a few days after that hearing on January 25, the Department of Homeland Security, announced how they had been handling the opioid epidemic and had launched an investigation March of 2017, a whole year preceding the Senate hearing. They had been tracking packages from coming from China for almost a year and They full on disclosed that ""The United States is in the midst of an illicit fentanyl epidemic that is multi-faceted and deadly."" It seems like our government is living on two completely different planets or one facet of government is living under a rock or in denial. One is admitting to what the REAL epidemic is and another part of government wants to keep blaming what is convenient. If it's all about costs, then lower the prices, but don't make pain patients the collateral damage and confuse us with individuals who are drug addicts. Narcan is also not the ""magic bullet."" And if a responder is called to administer Narcan, that individual should automatically be required to be admitted to a rehab facility, because that shot of Narcan just delayed the inevitable.

RE:	Docket number: CMS-2017-0163
 
Dear Mr. Kouzoukas,

I write to you on behalf of the P.R. College of Physicians and Surgeon (the ""CMCPR""), a compulsory association encompassing the totality of the licensed physicians in Puerto Rico. We subscribe the comments submitted by the Medicare and Medicaid Advantage Products Association of Puerto Rico (""MMAPA"") to the 2019 Medicare Advantage and Part D Advance Notice Part II and Draft Call Letter. However, on behalf of the approximately 9,000 physicians licensed in Puerto Rico, the CMCPR submits that CMS must approve regulation to ensure that the rate increases based on the higher cost of living and of providing services is passed on to the providers who actually incur in those higher costs, and is NOT kept by the health insurance company as is currently happening.

CMS has acknowledged that a far greater proportion of Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico receive benefits through Medicare Advantage than in any state or territory. The high concentration of these patients in the handful of Medical Advantage insurers in Puerto Rico has led to a concentration of market power to the ultimate detriment of the patients. This market power has been used by such insurers and their affiliates to force providers to accept such conditions such as unreasonably low payment rates and the contracting of TPAs who impose unreasonable conditions, the termination without cause or one-sided modification of provider contracts, in order not to be forced out of the market. This practice has led to a massive exodus of physicians from the Island, causing a shortage in specialists and a long waiting period for patients to see these doctors. It has also led to the concentration of patients in fewer physicians, to the detriment of the healthcare the patients receive. Additionally, it has also caused patients to leave to seek treatment, splitting families apart. 
 
History has shown that increasing rates to Medicare Advantage insurers in Puerto Rico based on higher costs of providing the services is no guarantee that such increase will be passed on to the party who actually bears the cost. As CMCPR has consistently denounced, the recent increase based on a revised GPCI for Puerto Rico did not result in an increase in rates paid to providers; to the contrary, Medicare Advantage insurers kept the increase for themselves. CMS must make sure for the ultimate benefit of the Medicare Advantage patients that increases based on higher cost of living or of providing services is passed on to the provider who bears the increase in cost and is not kept by the insurer to increase profits for its shareholders.

We trust that CMS will take our comments into consideration and that it will act accordingly to protect its patients in Puerto Rico.

Attentively,

In August 1995 a freak accident caused CRPS in my left foot and leg. I spent the next four years trying experimental treatments and nerve blocks attempting to relieve the pain. I'm extremely saddened to say nothing worked to stop the worst pain I've ever experienced. The only thing at that time and for the next 22 years to provide me with some reasonable pain relief is opiates. The pain clinic started me on fentanyl pain patches then moved me to OxyContin in 2000. (Now you need to understand that even with the OxyContin my pain very rarely was ever under a level of 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst.) CRPS is ranked as the most painful form of chronic pain that exist today by the McGill Pain Index. I don't need an index to tell me it's the worst pain ever. This
 chronic pain has left me with the inability to work, concentrate, sleep, or contribute to family and community. Living in chronic pain for 22 years it has taken a toll on my overall health. We cannot change my CRPS, but we can control how bad it hurts. The thought of returning to that initial pain due to improper dosing or no access at all is the most frightening thing to me. I have never been so scared of anything in my life, but you have the power to help me from this point forward by allowing access to the adequately needed opioids to help control my chronic pain. Please respect my Doctor and me to decide how best to treat my chronic pain. I have never lost a pill, used more than specified or ever asked for more than prescribed. Why am I & others being judged by actions of someone else. When I stop following the rules then yes take my right to treatment away, but I have done nothing wrong. Please, I'm asking for some compassion.
  Ask yourself - what is the worst pain you have ever had? Now imagine that pain never stops in 22 years going 24 hours a day seven days a week. Would you want to live that way? I think we know the answer to that question. So again ask yourself why would anyone else ever deserve to live in that kind of pain when there is something that helps? It's so cruel to deny pain patient medicine. We don't even let out animals live in this kind of pain. It's considered inhumane. So what do we call it when we make people live in extreme debilitating pain?Again it's cruel. It saddens me when I think my life and my family's life have already been pushed to the limit and it can be destroyed by denying access to much needed pain medication. I didn't ask for or have any control over the freak accident of a coffee cup hitting my foot. If you deny pain patients it is no freak accident. I'm asking you to do the right thing for pain patients and see the good that opioids have and can bring patients, and families. I'm a real live person using opioids correctly to managing my pain for a life that no one would ever want. When you live in chronic pain believe me you would do anything you could to relieve it. I ask again why am I being punished when I did nothing wrong I don't want CRPS, but I don't have a choice it's not like I can just walk away from it or say go away. I'm pretty sure when you start your day it's not controlled by pain, or I sure hope not because it's the cruelest of cruel. Without pain meds, it is just torture plan & simple.

We primarily come into patient's homes as that is where the vast majority of people in our country wish to die. We want to honor that wish. They also wish to die peacefully and comfortably. It can be scary to consider caring for a loved one at home, giving medications and being responsible for their care. Hospice provides the knowledge and a holistic team of caregivers to support patients and their families at home.  It means a heavy burden of caregiving which is a 24 hour a day for families. It's physically demanding, emotionally exhausting and can be socially isolating; there are long hours and no pay for most of these family caregivers.  For many patients on hospice, their symptoms change quickly and their medication needs significant. It is unfortunate that these proposed reforms do not guarantee exception of this special population and except hospice care to the limit of morphine that is able to be prescribed. 

I once held the hand of a patient on hospice for cancer with bone mets. The type of cancer is unimportant. Imaging I'm talking about your parent, or spouse, or best friend.  Their pain kept increasing and increasing as they declined. Bone pain is an experience I would never wish on anyone, its torturous. I held their hand and offered soothing presence and reassurance as our team tried to determine how best to increase medications to provide relief, as that is hospice's job.  A strong person, they didn't scream or thrash but I could feel their entire body taut from the pain ravaging through their body. Only silent tears, hot, angry, desperate tears. What would you say to that patient if the reason that their hospice team could not provide any more relief was because they were at the maximum allowed? What do you say to that family having to watch their loved one struggle and suffer with no relief in sight because their government had tied their providers hands limiting what support they could provide?

Opioid misuse is certainly something on hospice agencies radars as we are often providing significant medication, appropriately for the end stage illnesses we are treating such as cancer. Hospice providers do not prescribe medications lightly and issues of misuse and diversion are something that are taken seriously and watched carefully.  

I don't think limiting providers is an appropriate role of government, there are many other avenues to work with to address the opioid epidemic that I won't delineate here. We should consider the unintended consequences of a rule like this. There will exist patients that need more medications than the limit allows a prescription to be filled. The only place those patients will be able to be cared for is in the hospital.  I highly doubt that the private insurances Medicare is going to want to pay for that level of care when it is not necessary. But creating a limit to what can occur in the outpatient setting will mean that needing more pain medication requires inpatient care, and that is expensive to provide, creating significant costs to our country.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0103","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Anonymous-MI"

That may be a futile fentanyl dose in one dying with bony metastases and longterm opioid use from cancer pain.  Please don't demand that my patients suffer , they who have entrusted me with their final days.

I completely agree with appropriate measures to quell this horrible opioid death crisis.  I have completed REMS training, not required for hospice providers at this time.  My hospice provides lockboxes for opioids in the home to deter diversion.  We are alert!

Please do not limit opioid prescription at end of life. Please do not require only hospital use of high dose opioids (what a financial disaster for CMS and patients' goals)!  And ask your so-called experts to sit at the bedside of a screaming, thrashing man or woman dying with metastatic cancer and say, ""Sorry, you are at 90 MME.""

"76","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"This is completely irresponsible regulation formed because of the current hysteria around opioid addiction. Having been an addict for many years, although not to opioids, and now 15 years sober, I have seen a thing or two concerning opiate and opioid addiction and withdrawal. I have a unique condition that caused my immune system to destroy all of my cartilage - including the disks in my spine, so naturally, throughout my 95 operations these last 15 years, I have been prescribed opiates and opioids off and on for years. After, what I thought at the time was my final operation, I entered a medical detox to get off my post-op pain meds other than Ibuprofen because I hate the way that these drugs affected my ability concentrate. After 72 days, I was down to 1 mg a day of methadone. Unfortunately, I was in such excruciating pain, that I had to take a small amount of medication to get by. 2 weeks later, I was back in the hospital having yet another spine operation. 

My physician was quite puzzled by my attempt to detox, as he didn't recommend it, and believed that I was absolutely justified in having pain that needed these medications. Today, I am taking the same dose I have taken for years, as it works for me. After a recent revision of a 3 year old hip replacement that had loosened, I spent 2 weeks in a rehabilitation hospital and the medical director wanted to give me a small dose of Oxycodone for breakthrough pain after discharge. My Medicare D provider, as it does routinely, sent this new provider who was prescribing Class 2 medication a 'prior authorization' request. This young doctor called me 2 nights after my discharge at 9pm hysterical that 'the feds' might be coming down on him and he was too afraid to have anything extraneous on his record, and refused to certify the prescription. Despite my attempts to explain that this was standard operating procedure, he maintained and I dealt with it. The fact that a Doctor in his position was too scared to prescribe what he deemed appropriate is unbelievable and evidence that a rule change like this has too much peril for the patients who need these drugs.

I implore you not to adopt this rule change and let calmer minds prevail.

     I am a Medicare patient who is also a chronic pain patient diagnosed with a semi successful nerve graft in my shoulder, fully fused spine, and extensive nerve damage due to my spine collapsing. Due to the nerve damage injections and devices won't help me. I have tried every prescription medication out there before being prescribed opioids. They dull the pain enough so that I am able to walk. If I lose them I am looking at being bedridden or in a wheelchair.
     I have responsibly taken them for years and abide strictly by the pain contract. My condition is expected to worsen with time and has. Without medication I will need home care. My medical costs will skyrocket. My blood pressure will worsen. I will be in a wheelchair. If I do not have access to over 90 MME I am looking at all of the above and a drastic life change.
     The guidelines were written by non pain management physicians and proposed policies are not supported by studies. These policies are disastrous for pain patients and will cause health problems and costs to rise substantially. They will cost us our freedom, quality of life, and affect our relationships.
     I am disabled, not over 65, and pain meds make my life bearable. Any treatment of my condition should be left up to my doctor, who understands my condition and circumstances and not Medicare. 
     A 7 day limit is quite an impossibility for me due to financial hardship and inability to travel frequently. Due to the nerve damage I am unable to drive long distances. I take Oxycodone safely as prescribed. I am not a drinker nor do I do illegal drugs. This crisis is due to heroin and Fentanyl but is not an over prescribing issue. Please consider my life when making your decision. Thank you.

I am an orthopedic surgeon, and I often treat patients who live several hours away from my community.  Given the current requirement for written prescriptions for schedule II narcotics, adding a limit of a seven day supply would create significant burdens for our elderly patients who require pain medications for acute fractures and joint replacement related pain.  Many of these patients have limited support systems and significant travel restrictions.  Many of them are unable to drive due to their injuries.  Many of them are unable to secure reliable transportation.  If imposed, the seven day prescription limit would create situations for some of my patients where they are unable to access needed pain medication.  Many patients with orthopedic injuries require narcotic medication beyond the one week time frame proposed.  

Although I support efforts to reduce opioid dependence and abuse, I often feel that policies are created which do not consider unique challenges presented in rural practice situations.  The requirement for written prescriptions and inability to phone in prescriptions has already created issues for some of my rural patients.

 I also feel like there is insufficient attention afforded to the difference between acute and chronic pain management.  The acute injury requires a different approach and is less easily regulated because of the inherent variability in injury severity, pain tolerance, and numerous other patient factors.

I would suggest extending the one week limit to two weeks for acute injuries and post-op patients.  Further, I would suggest evaluating the efficacy of any implemented regulatory change.  If a regulation provides no measurable improvement, it should be actively eliminated, or perhaps the regulation should be designed to expire unless acted upon.

"87","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My name is Bruce Scott, MD HMDC FACP. I am fellowship-trained and board certified in Hospice and Palliative Medicine, with additional Hospice Medical Director Certification. I have worked in inpatient and outpatient palliative medicine as well as hospice in academic, community, and Veterans Administration settings. I have served as program director or associate program director for Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship, Geriatrics fellowship, and Internal Medicine residency. I accept no pharmaceutical money whatsoever. 

I am writing this letter in opposition to parts of the 2018 Draft Call Letter Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls (Opioids).

Flagging of alpha-2 delta ligands pregabalin and gabapentin as high-risk potentiators is short-sighted and inappropriate. These are typically used as opioid-sparing agents which allow lower opioid doses to be used. They are also used in mixed-pain types that include both somatic and neuropathic components or have a degree of central sensitization. In these cases, the gabapentinoids allow for lower doses of opioids to achieve the same or superior analgesia. Any impediments to their use will likely (perhaps as an unintended consequence) result in increased total opioid dosing to achieve the same degree of analgesia. The types of pain most responsive to gabapentinoids are less responsive to opioids as single agents. 

Prior authorizations are onerous and uncompensated. The reviewer rarely has subject area expertise. I already spend a great deal of time doing these prior authorization exercises. They often require extensive forms and then one or two follow up phone calls. Increasing the administrative burden of prior authorizations by requiring them for more patients will make it harder for me to provide care to patients and ensure they get their medically necessary prescriptions. All time spent on such work necessarily detracts from time I could otherwise be caring for patients. 

The draft doesn't include exemptions for hospice or palliative medicine, where we often see patients with widespread painful bony metastases who are referred because their advancing disease plus expected physiologic tolerance have necessitated total doses above the 90 OMME. The draft also does not make an exemption for known painful conditions such as sickle cell pain. These patients are living longer than they have previously, leading to the development of mixed chronic pain. They are often very vulnerable patient populations as well. In my last clinical setting, I had a large sickle cell population. These guidelines would essentially make taking care of this population financially difficult. The majority of these patients are black and often experience significant health care inequalities already. This regulation would only serve to increase these inequalities. 

The draft does not address patient-to-patient variability in opioid equianalgesic doses, nor the difference of opinion among experts for conversation ratios. Those conversions in use clinically often differ from those in the packaging. Various online calculators and printed conversion sheets have differing ratios and even highly experienced clinicians will estimate these differently. (Rennick et al, Variability in Opioid Equivalence Calculations, Pain Medicine 2016; 17: 892-898) Methadone, with non-linear dosing kinetics, cannot easily be converted to oral morphine milligram equivalents and has widely variable patient-to-patient efficacy and extensive drug interaction effects. It should be entirely exempted from this sort of limit. The 90 mg limit does not include any adjustments for age, gender, genetic phenotypes, or drug interactions, all of which can have serious effects on equianalgesic conversions. Many opioids undergo extensive metabolism, which is affected by underlying genetic phenotype as well as by other medications used. The simplistic rules suggested here do not take this into account. (Galer et al, Individual variability in the response to different opioids: report of five cases. Pain 1992 Apr; 49(1):87-91)

Opioids can be addictive substances. Economic theory maintains that the way to reduce overall consumption of addictive substances is to reduce the demand, not the supply. The efficient way to reduce non-medical consumption is to more fully fund comprehensive substance abuse treatment programs, rather than try to restrict the small amount of supply that is illegally stolen from or sold by patients who got them by prescription. The latter approach hurts many patients in order to try to reduce the supply of diverted medications. Restrictive prescription approaches have not been successful in reducing total opioid-related deaths, only in shifting these deaths from prescription medications to illicit drugs. For those with substance use disorders, decreased supply will generally not stop them from trying to obtain opioids, it will only cause them to engage in more risky behaviors to acquire them.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-1010","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Bruce Scott-PA"

That was eight years ago and I've never worked day since. I have tried everything to help pain, like creams, tens units, multiple monthly sessions of physical therapy for literally years, and massage and etc. I Can't forget 30 different injections from base of my neck to my tailbone. Again none of the above minimized my Daily cronic pain. Even after the surgery the pain got worse. Unfortunately now the only thing that works for me is opioids. I wear a Butrans pain patch, they are a 7-Day patch but they only work for about 5 days. Therefore I'm prescribed Norco or Vicodin, 7.5 mg twice day. This is for breakthrough paint and I definitely need this also.
   Currently I am struggling to keep my house. It's an old two-story hundred-year-old home that I've been in for 20 years. I can no longer take care of the household duties that it takes to keep the house up. I have no relatives or close friends that could help me. If any agency such as the CDC or the DEA or my doctor or my Pharmacy that I've been using for 15 years, if any of the agencies reduce or eliminate any of my pain medications I will certainly be on my deathbed within 2 months. I know this for a fact due to going for 2 days with no pain medicine in my system before.  I was almost in the ER due to the untreated pain. My pain is so excruciating you can't sleep or sit or walk. You can imagine there's not much else. I find it insulting that the CDC is in my family doctor appointment pressuring my Dr not to give me medications that work and help me live my life. Take for granted, my life is not normal. Living in chronic pain is a hour by hour process. Taking care of oneself with two to three showers a week is a struggle. Making meals are difficult. I no longer can mow my yard or shovel the snow if it happens. My sleep habits are 2 hours at a time at different locations every 2 hours. I cycled between bed to loveseat the couch to recliner. I fluctuate between. I would require nursing care 24 hours a day. I wouldn't be able to take the excruciating pain very long. As I stated, I will lose my house in the future. Due to the stairs and my declining health. At that point I will be at the mercy of the state living in a home at the age of 58. What a travesty that would be for the rest of my life. Currently I struggle to walk my dogs around the block twice a week. That is the most enjoyment I get. I get no social life. No one wants to be around someone who has to force a smile to look normal.
  So in summary, please push your emphasis on stopping Fentanyl and morphine and heroin that is coming from China and Mexico by The boatloads. That is what is killing hundreds of kids are dieing across the country. Pain patients or not in that group. We don't get Euphoria from opioids. We get a reduction in pain so that we can get out of bed and think about approaching the day. Somewhat semi-functional but at least alive and walking around my home. I also would wish that my local state and federal government would keep CDC and the pharmacies in the insurance companies away from that 90mm guideline because it's killing people. I thought doctors had a predge ""Do No Harm!? The Suicide rates are climbing in the pain community. This back cannot be denied, so don't  assume there's one crisis in our country. There is two crisis occuring at the same time. The pain patient advocacy groups are struggling to keep the medication that gives relief to millions of people available. IT'S OUR RIGHT! Leave the pain patients alone and stay out of our personal medical discussions with our Doctor.
   As a single parent I've struggled my entire life. I didn't ask to be injured on the job, at no fault of mine. My son is planning to graduate from college end of April. Without my medications,  I can't attend the graduation. It's too far to drive and I have to pay someone to drive me. I can't be behind the wheel more than an hour at a time. So a 6 hour ride one way is almost out of the question. But w/o my prescribed medications  (Same meds & dosage for 5 years ), I'll be lying in bed writhing in extreme horrific pain.

"96","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a future Medicare patient. I am a pain patient diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia for eight years. I tried anti-epileptics, NSAIDS, Lyrica, and Klonipin BEFORE opioids. I have also had brain surgery to relieve the horrendous pain.The medications all failed to adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and allow me to teach, take care of my children, and have a somewhat normal life.

If Medicare or a private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication, I will be unable to leave my house, I will be unable to interact with other people, I will be unable to earn a living, I will be able to do nothing but suffer. I will live to suffer. 

I am a model patient. I have always used my medication responsibly. I am honest with my doctor, and she trusts me. As a religious person, marijuana an suicide are not options for me. Marijuana does not help my condition anyway. My condition will never improve, and my only hope for a life is continued availability of opioid medication. 

Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.

These policies WILL create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, and create more disability claims and unemployment, as well as the need for social services.

Forcing involuntary tapers and withdrawals cause suicides. They also cause high blood pressure, strokes, and cardiac issues.

Pain medication helps me stay active. Pain medication keeps me from being disabled. My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not Medicare or an insurance company.
A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, extra paperwork burden for my doctor (and she is already overburdened), extra copays at pharmacies and doctors, plus another very difficult trip to a doctor or pharmacy doctor/pharmacy while I am in severe pain.

A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - the arbitrary limits don't take into account type of injury or condition, genetics or other factors.

I take Klonipin and hydrocodone safely. I do not drink alcohol or mix them with other substances. If I have no way to control my pain, my only option will be suicide. People in chronic pain are choosing to end their lives in greater numbers. Why aren't you addressing this?

We appreciate the continued effort of CMS to reduce opioid overutilization.  The United States consistently leads the world in rates of opioid use and non-medical use (Tetrault & Butner, 2015).  Increasing sales of opioids correlates with increased rates of overdoses (Tetrault & Butner, 2015), likely due to increased availability for diversion.  It is reasonable to infer that reducing the availability of opioids will, in the long term, reduce rates of opioid dependence and overdose.  Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control found that rates of opioid dependence and overdose increase significantly when opioid prescriptions extend beyond 7 days (Shah et al., 2017).  

However, this approach is not without limitations.  Recent data suggests that prescription drug monitoring programs have no impact on measures of nonmedical prescription opioid use (e.g. abuse, dependence, initiation), and may result in increased heroin use (Ali et al., 2017).  Others have also reported disturbing trends of increasing shifts from prescription opioids to illicit opioids such as heroin (Dasgupta et al., 2014) and non-pharmaceutical fentanyl.  Moreover, even relatively short initial prescriptions of opioids lead to continued opioid use.  The aforementioned analysis by the Centers for Disease Control found that the one-year probability of continued opioid use in a treatment nave population was 6% (Shah et al., 2017).  Thus, while limiting opioid prescription length is a necessary and helpful measure, more must be done to reduce initial exposure to opioids and treat underlying biopsychosocial factors leading to opioid misuse.

It is estimated that approximately 50-75% of the liability for opioid use disorders is genetically mediated (Berrettini, 2017; CASA, 2012).  Multiple genetic variants have been discovered and validated through replication in independent samples (Berrettini, 2017; Mistry, et al, 2014).  Research on polygenic risk algorithms for the prediction of opioid addiction liability is also increasing, with one product demonstrating 97% sensitivity and 87% specificity for distinguishing between opioid dependent individuals and healthy controls (Donaldson, et al, 2017).   

We request that CMS evaluate the implementation of such genetic tests to screen for increased opioid dependence liability.  Large-scale implementation will help providers triage high-risk patients to non-opioid interventions (e.g. NSAIDS, cognitive behavioral therapy) that have demonstrated analgesic efficacy (Chang, et al, 2017; Van Denburg, et al 2017).  We thank CMS for the opportunity to comment on these proposed changes and look forward to working together to reduce opioid exposure, thereby helping millions of Americans avoid the tragic consequences of opioid use disorders.

I have years of physical therapy for the pain with very little relief, I have used a TENS unit with minimal improvement lasting only about a month, I have had multiple steroid injections of the joints in the back, the muscles in my neck, the piriformis muscle, and of both sides of the S/I joints and areas of bursitis.  I do get some short term partial relief from the injections but because of the systemic effects of steroids I can only receive 3 injections a year and I have a lot more places then that which have severe pain so I have to choose what I think is the worst site at the time and still hurt from the other sources.  I have taken Gabapentin with minimal improvement but have recently had to stop it because of side effects I have done relaxation and heat therapy with minimal improvement of overlying muscle spasm only.  I have had a pain stimulator inserted and then removed after a severe allergic reaction and it did not help my pain while in.  Currently steroid injections are on hold because of an immune system problem and low grade fevers after the last one.  I have deterioration of my brain per MRI consistent with the deterioration that happens with ongoing severe pain  and it has effected my ability to remember, word finding ability, and ability to concentrate and to multi task.  I have not had another MRI since being started on opiates to evaluate this but I have found my memory to be slightly improved since starting them.  I have severe problems sleeping because of pain and while this is improved since beginning opiates it is still a problem.  I have received no pain relief through prayer, essential oils, or relaxation therapy. I have tried Yoga but further injured my back as well as falling.  I was at the point of being suicidal before I was ever placed on opiods.  I have now been on them for several years and am well over the maximium recomended published in CDC recomendations.  I have never taken even one extra pill and have had no side effects from them other then some minor constipation. It is time that the government educates themselves about all the secondary problems from  severe chronic pain  and that they acknowledge that cancer is not the only source of severe unremitting pain and that it needs to be appropriately treated to prevent some of the problems like significant brain deterioration and suicide  and the development of chronic pain syndrome which many researchers believe is a disease and not a symptom and which happens with inadequate pain management. They should also educate themselves regarding the latest statistics regarding the so called opiate problem which show that 80% of it is heroin and not prescription pain medicine.  Those folks who DO overdose on prescription pain meds are usually taking street drugs or alcohol in addition to the medicine and are usually obtaining pain meds on the street rather then from a doctor.  This is NOT a problem caused by over prescribing these drugs except in a few isolated cases.  They are also NOT addictive to the vast majority of patients taking them.  When you are on them long term you will develop a reversible physical dependance where they need to be gradually stopped rather then stopped cold turkey but this is not the same as an addiction where there is long lasting craving not related to the pain relief benefits of the medicine.  In fact a 2010 Cochrane study of addiction and pain medicine showed less then 2 out of a thousand patients will develop a true addiction to opiates even with long term use if they did not have a pre-existing addiction problem. The CDC guidelines were not based on advice from a knowledgable base of unbiased pain specialists nor on up to date scientific studies regarding pain and its side effects and basing treatment decisions on that advice is likely to cause significant harm to patients as well as an increase in long term medicare costs as more people develop chronic pain syndrome from inadequate pain control and seek treatments which are often innefective for severe unremitting chronic pain.

It began  while I was a young Professor in Minnesota. Not having a diagnosis, they could only consider M. S.  Many years later it was discovered that I had lupus and also a genetic disease which was destroying the cartilage in my joints and creating severe pain and degeneration in my spine. 
     I have the bones of a very old woman and nothing can change that. Every so often I have surgery, a joint replaced, a jawbone replaced, a knee replaced. The surgeries themselves have left me with problems. A nerve cut in my face has made me look different on one side than the other. Now I need another jaw replacement and fear it because of the previous one.  
       I went on with my life, thanks to opioids and other meds. and continued as a Professor in Colorado and also a well-known writer. I write novels and essays, have received numerous awards, including being short-listed for a Pulitzer. I also write books of poetry. 
      At home I live with a mustang and a wild burro that I have gentled. I am not only physically active at home, but also a public speaker about writing or about my own work.
     I am in no way an addict, yet I depend on these medications you would like to take away from so many of us.  Without those medication my life would drastically be destroyed. The fear and anger about ""drugs"" have not taken into consideration the many people who are not addicts but who truly need these opioid medications for their original purpose as pain relievers.  My own life would go from one of daily activity, working, caring for my horses, gardening, and working, to being a person who is bedridden. I worked in nursing homes when a young woman and I know what that would mean.  
    I would lose everything I love; my home, my horses, my ability to work, and worse, my need to think clearly. 
For those of you who do not have pain, you cannot imagine what it is like to try to survive the chronic pain many of us would have to endure without our medications. 
     For the sake of myself and others who, like me, sincerely need the so-called ""drugs"" as real medicine, please consider your own guidelines and the fear that this war on opioids has caused our doctors, and the even more serious fear of pain that some of us have.

"107","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the 2019 Advance Notice and Call Letter for Medicare Advantage and Part D. Please see our full comment letter posted to this website.

ACHP is a national leadership organization bringing together health plans and provider organizations that are among America's best at delivering affordable, high-quality coverage and care.  Members are non-profit plans active in 30 states and the District of Columbia, providing both private and public coverage to more than 19 million Americans, including 2.3 million Medicare beneficiaries. 

We greatly appreciate CMS' commitment to providing regulatory flexibility and relief from outdated or burdensome requirements in this Advance Notice and Call Letter and in the previously proposed rule for MA and Part D. Proposals in both documents reflect recommendations that ACHP has previously offered and will facilitate the ability of plan sponsors to strengthen benefits that reflect the needs of their enrollees and administer coverage efficiently.

The following summary highlights ACHP's response to several issues in the 2019 Advance Notice and Call Letter:

	Restoring Quality Payments: ACHP urges CMS to pay full quality bonuses created by Congress to ensure seniors receive the highest possible quality of care. We continue to believe that the statute allows the Secretary discretion to exclude the quality payments from the benchmark cap calculation, as is done in other Medicare programs.

	Improving Accuracy of the Benchmark Calculation:  While the issue is not directly addressed in the Advance Notice, ACHP urges CMS to revise its calculation of FFS costs. Part A-only FFS beneficiaries have very different utilization and cost patterns from those who enroll in both A and B - and they are a growing segment of the FFS population.  The result is that county MA benchmarks, driven by FFS costs, are lower than they would be if the appropriate comparison group were used - i.e., A/B enrollees.  

	Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls for Opioid Overuse/Misuse: We applaud CMS' commitment to using its authority to address the nationwide opioid epidemic. We strongly support the proposal to incorporate a 7-day limit on opioid prescriptions for first-time opioid users. We recommend  that cumulative daily dosage edits at the point of sale would be more effective if plan sponsors are permitted to require that specific criteria are met before a hard edit may be overridden, beyond simply having the provider attest to the prescription's medical necessity.   

	Health-Related Supplemental Benefits: ACHP supports the additional flexibility proposed in allowing health-related services to be covered as supplemental benefits. The expanded definition of supplemental benefits  strengthens the ability of health plans to address the home environment and other factors affecting health status and provide care tailored to individual needs.

	Star Ratings: We appreciate CMS' commitment to quality improvement and the star ratings and welcome the plan to establish a Technical Expert Panel for future consultation on the ratings. We urge CMS to discontinue use of the improvement measures which distort the star ratings and are unnecessary given that the entire purpose of the ratings is to incentivize improvement. 

	Proposed Part C Risk Adjustment Model:  ACHP appreciates development of the Payment Condition Count CMS-HCC model but recommends delay until 2020, in order for CMS and plan sponsors to analyze its potential effects and adjust to the revised HCC model. 

	Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs):  ACHP recommends that CMS continue to phase-in use of the individual bid-to-benchmark ratio to calculate the Part C base payment for EGWPs for the 2019 MA EGWP payment rates. Given the magnitude of the change, we recommend retaining the 50/50 blend of individual and EGWP bids for 2019.  

	Coding Intensity Adjustment:  ACHP is pleased that CMS will not increase the coding intensity adjustment beyond the statutory minimum of -5.91 percent.  We recommend that future adjustments differentiate among plans according to coding patterns as MedPAC has proposed.  

	Normalization Factor:  ACHP encourages CMS to calibrate the Part C risk adjustment models with 2015 diagnoses and 2016 costs so that the FFS normalization factor is 1.000 for the year 2016 rather than 1.000 for 2015, resulting in a more accurate forecast of the normalization factor.

"112","CMS",FALSE,3,NA,NA,"

I am a 38 year old mother of two, and I was a PTA for 7 years, and an RN student, an artist, a writer, an author, a traveler, a child care provider, a server, a manager, a human resources administrative assistant, a home business owner, a swimmer, a hiker, a journalist, an editor, a painter, a sculptor, a blogger, a volunteer for mobile spay/neuter clinics, a home health aide, a youth group leader, a church bus driver, a MOTHER, an online tutor in English, a patient advocate, a bus monitor, a cashier, a hostess, a dancer, a singer, a poet, and I wore many, many other hats. 
This was all before being hit by a drunk driver and enduring a six-hour brain surgery and a 7 hour back surgery.  I am now unable to do 98% of the things I used to do, love, and enjoy.  The CDC/lawmakers took my quality of life.  Now remove the words ""quality of"".  The CDC/lawmakers took my life.
   I stayed at UK hospital in Lexington KY for 115 (one hundred fifteen) days.  I was prescribed pain control medication to care for my pain.  I now have failed back surgery syndrome, fibromyalgia, compression fractures in the spine, narrowing spinal cord, metallic fragments in the neck and brain from neurosurgery, and a host of other painful conditions.  I was cut completely from my medicine, without warning, and suffered for 28 days straight, with seizures (which I never had before this crime) and withdrawal from stopping medications abruptly, which by the grace of God, did not kill me.  I had three seizures during this time, and I have never been epileptic and have never had seizures before or after this. Lyrica 450mg/day to zero.  Oxycodone 80mg/day to zero.  Cymbalta 30mg/day to zero.  
   People are dying in epic proportions due to suicide, and a huge percentage of these people had no mental health issues...they just could not stand the pain and the forced withdrawal or taper, thanks to these guidelines being used as concrete laws.  People are going to use drugs, whether they're legal or not.  The problem still exists.  
And now that these prescribing guidelines are being played with, people are not getting pain care, so many have turned to the street, and have been introduced to the world of illicit fentanyl mixed with so called heroin, and they're also dropping like flies.  Kinda retroactive.  The purpose of the CDC guidelines was to decline addiction rates.  The purpose has failed and has caused the rates to NOT decline, NOT stay the same, but SKYROCKETED in dramatically epidemically numbered proportions.  Harm has been caused, and crime has been placed at the doorstep of already suffering patients.  There is blood on someone's hands.  I would think this would bother you, as it does me.  I stay awake at night and cry over the people who are contemplating ending their lives due to this atrocious situation.  Do not punish people who are already suffering!  What about mandatory rehab, rather than jail?  Why make someone who is already suffering, suffer even more...to the point of death?  Pain care gives back the quality of life that many millions of people would not have if their care was abruptly stopped like mine was.  It's time to put a stop to this.  I can put thousands of faces with thousands of names, if you wish.  Let's just hope they're not obituary pictures by the time you make a change.

Please make it possible for palliative care patients to have the medicine they need for pain, without being treated as a criminal.  Even those without cancer should be treated with pain medication if they have these debilitating diseases, as the neuro-pathways in in the body are all the same, and there is no distinction between Cancer pain and chronic pain. I can and will provide documentation to prove this.

 I have many life shortening and debilitating illnesses which have disabled me...one is adhesive arachnoiditis,  which is listed as one of the top most painful diseases. That's on top of the torn ligaments in my ankles from avulsion fractures and torn ligaments in my shoulder,  all from car accident when I was hit by a drunk driver while my sons were in the car. 

If you tell a Dr you're in pain, you're automatically treated like an addict.  At least legalize marijuana if you aren't going to allow CPPs to have the medicine we need to live somewhat normal lives. This is genocide...people are killing themselves because they can't handle the pain. Some are turning to the streets where they're dying from heroin mixed with illicit fentanyl. How is this ok? Please, fix this! I voted for you! God help us all! I trust Him, that He will pull your heartstrings to do what is right. Fight the cdc guidelines.  Help us live.

After years & years of trying to use other alt.methods for pain, injections, massage, PT, biofeedback.my medication is what keeps me going.
I stand with other chronic pain sufferers off in the shadows. We have been forgotten. No research. No treatment. Now there are laws and a movement of public outcry condemning pain medicine use. Our pain medicine is being taken from us. We have been treated without compassion, humiliated, stripped of dignity. People don't understand that we are not abusers but simply seek temporary relief from our endless pain. We are always tired, often depressed and feeling hopeless. We are just trying to overcome the obstacles our bodies have presented to us. We are made to feel shame because we need to use pain medicine to cope with everyday life.
I am the other side of the opiate crisis. I am not an addict. I take pain medication to function at a minimal level and not allow my chronic pain get the better of me. It lets me feel normal for a short time every day. I never feel ""high"" from taking it, just almost ""normal."" It allows me to focus and to do simple tasks that I could not otherwise perform
There are other things chronic pain sufferers do to relieve pain. In an effort to distract ourselves we meditate, pray, use alternative methods like massage, tens units and have hobbies like reading and simply being able to step outside and breathe the air and enjoy the sunshine. We do many thing to take our minds off of our pain, We attempt to stay positive even when it feels impossible. A short relief from pain helps. Pain medicine helps us function, at least for a short time, in a way that most people take for granted.

"121","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a person suffering from chronic, intractable pain from degenerative spine disease, spondylosis, arthritis and nerve damage.  I have been suffering constant, debilitating pain for nearly thirty years.  For several years, I endured all treatment options available (physical therapy, chiropractic, TENS, steroid injections, spinal cord stimulator, morphine pump and others) without pain relief.  My neurologist advised that surgical treatment was impossible.  The only treatment that has provided any relief and quality of life improvement has been a managed pain medication program.

I have always seen one pain management physician and taken prescribed pain medication as directed and only to reduce my pain level to a tolerable level.  I have never had issues complying with my physician's treatment contract.

The recent CDC prescribing ""guidelines"" are not based on good science and do not account for the individualized treatment need of intractable pain patients.  This broad-brush approach to trying to solve a perceived problem (opioid crisis) is negatively impacting patients, physicians, pharmacists and their families.  Many doctors, fearing DEA retribution, are suddenly dropping patients or refusing to prescribe pain medication.  Likewise, pharmacies are refusing to fill legal prescriptions for pain medication (I personally experienced this at a pharmacy I patronized for 15-years and I was specifically told by the pharmacist that he feared the DEA).  Furthermore, insurance company administrators are refusing to cover pain medications when quantities exceed the CDC guidelines even when physicians state this is a medical necessity.

As a result, patients are suffering unnecessarily; becoming home bound, unemployed and unable to function normally.  Worse yet, an increasing number succumb to the pain and commit suicide.

Further regulation that essentially penalizes law-abiding patients in deference to addicts is not going to solve any ""crisis"".  I implore you to protect patients' rights to compassionate care and physicians' rights to practice responsible medicine and ""do no harm"".

"122","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a 100% disabled veteran who suffers in chronic pain due to spinal injuries and other injuries. This ""regulation"" of medications is a good thing in general, but in the last couple of years it has gotten ridiculous. This policy just continues and continues to the ultimate end which will be the complete ""outlawing"" of pain. Things have gotten utterly ridiculous, where pain patients like me must jump through incredible hoops - not to mention doctors and the pharmacies - just to receive such medicines. It has gotten to the point that ultimately this will mandate that people like me; with long and thoroughly documented medical files/records, will just have to do without pain medications and live a life of desperation and suffering. It seems very apparent that people like myself will have no place in this new world, and that we will have to end our lives just to live without pain. This is no joke, and many of us have tried every modality of treatment, with many undergoing surgery (even more than once). While having to live with pain medications is not ideal, at least it allows us some type of existence where we might live and be productive members of society. However, it does not appear that this matters to the anti-pain zealots. All I can see for an end game; based on the last several years of increasingly stiffened regulations, is the continued ""regulation"" of pain medications until this society finally ""OUTLAWS"" pain altogether. Not only is this naive and ridiculous, but this is going to cause a drastically increased rise in the number of suicides each year due to people who cannot stand to live in pain any longer. This cannot come as any kind of surprise to the advocates of this increasingly severe ""policy.""

     As such, the question then must be asked whether the advocates of this ""policy"" are aware of this inevitable result? The truthful answer MUST be, how can they not see this or anticipate such a result?! Obviously, such people living in pain are of NO consequence to such advocates of this ""policy."" If we are to be honest, the governmental entities and ""advocates"" of this ever tightening noose around the necks of those of us unlucky enough to live in such circumstances, are absolutely unconcerned with such results. Truth be told, this would seem to work out to their benefit in several respects: they can stop paying for these medications every month, and if/when such pain patients ultimately end their lives this works out in that the governmental entities (Medicare, the VA, etc.) can then discontinue paying monthly benefits to these recipients! HOW CAN THIS BE VIEWED IN ANY OTHER WAY?! This is nothing short of an all-out war on pain and those of us unlucky enough to live in such circumstances. We are told by providers that they will not/can not prescribe such medications; regardless of our circumstances, pain levels, of medical histories. How is this medicine? It does NOT matter how carefully we are prescribed or take such medications, we are just out of luck and must hurt! Is this the brave new world we now live in; where heartless bureaucrats dictate to doctors and pharmacies what they can and cannot do, regardless of the medical necessity or the history of the patients involved. It is quite clear that such ""policies"" have been dreamed up by people lucky enough to live pain free, not by people suffering in pain.//

     What do these policies propose for those of us stuck living in pain like myself, or for people terminally ill? Will they just have to ""suck it up"" and live in pain? Because if they are honest about such policies, this IS the end game -- to just live in pain until we can no longer bear it. Will there then be some great epiphany years down the road, after thousands (or tens or hundreds of thousands) of suicides; that this is now a ""bad"" and ""ineffective"" policy, and that this policy must now be reversed? What about the lives wasted in the interim? To be truthful, this ""epidemic"" was caused by the drug companies themselves pushing their new (and VERY profitable) product called Oxycontin, which was foisted upon the market 15 or 20 years ago. The ""rationale"" used by these companies, was that pain was (ironically) being ""under treated"" by physicians, and that this new product was designed to deal with that ""crisis."" PLEASE REVIEW THE HISTORICAL RECORD, and you will find this 100% true. NOW we are apparently in a new ""crisis"" and we have this new draconian (and never-ending spiraling ""policy""), whereby medical policy now goes to the polar extreme denying pain medications to people who really need these. Is this continually vacillating policy the best we can do? Is this how our government ""takes care"" of its old and infirm, or its disabled veterans, like me? Forgive me if I am not impressed. Can we not all see this situation for what it is, and pursue a better/more humane drug policy; especially for permanently disabled people who carefully and responsibly take medications as prescribed?","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0636","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Edmund Botha-SC"

When I was broken and wanted to quit one of my sons said,  "" Mom,  I know the power of a mothers love.""  I taught them to never give up,  and then they taught me.  However,  though I managed years without medical intervention,  when I did require it in 2016 you cannot imagine the horor me and my family experienced when I could not receive treatment for extensive intense pain that wound up lasting at peak hight over 3 months and in which even after two surgical procedures diet changed yoga cognitive therapy anything I could think of my pain levels still left me unable to even shop in a small dollar store or ride in a vehical.  I lost a whole yeart to a house bound state of being. When we drove threw town finally on the way to specialists and pain management I felt sick when I saw all the new construction of stores and many other things right there in my community.  Where had I been ?  Fighting for my life because every doctor was to afraid to prescribe the kinds of meds I needed.  Four months ago I got that help finnally.  In order for me to truly see great improvements it took me being on around the clock medications and though the doses may seem high I do not get high.  I get to walk !  As soon as I got some release from the pain,  I wasn't waisting time.  I wanted my life,  I love my life,  my family is my brightest joy.  I am the light at the heart of our families traditions and love.  They need me whole,  restricting accses to or limiting dosage of my  meds will cause a decline in my ability to keep the  ground I have gained.  Truly think about how sadness  dispare and hopelessness could affect say my family.  My Sons and my Strong Working Husband are already becoming bitter.  I believe education is the way,  I believe in the human spirit.  In this land that I love and my country from whom I trust,  we the people cannot make decions like these before finding a way to ensure that those in need of these meds will not have interruptions nor be abandoned  forceably tappered from their current dosages.  To do so is a gross violation of basic human rights and is morally wrong.  You are ethically bound to ensure this don't happen.

Proud to be an American where we do not justify inhumane treatment.  There is more data and real statistics out there,  if I can have accses to it you can too.  I don't have to prove what I know,  if something is done that harms me,  it is not for good.  I'm a voter and I am also ready to do as many others are also ready to do and this includes family and connections of all affluences,  simply step out from our insurers and the whole medical system corrupt with governmental intrusion.  Yes we all hold every person in the position to deal with the opioid epedemic to do it wisely and correctly.   Do not use your in action as justification to your over reaction.  Hello you dropped the ball,  we all did.  Now spread the education about,  for instance I had no idea about the recreational use by teenage students.   I do not want my meds to get into anyine elses hands,  having these meds is a grave responsibility and I do not treat that lightly.  I do not believe in lost meds,  I think the very idea of lost or stolen meds is near criminal negligence considering the risk of harms to others .   Although I stand to see that a great deal of money is to be made by the criminalization of opiate prescriptions threw criminal and civil suits.  But we sure let Big Tobacco make alot of money while its product legally marketed us.  And then we have liquor,  can't take it from us so u don't.   Let me say this,  people will always take care of themselves.  If your diabetic and meds were illegal would you stop taking them?  You can't do that could you,  it could and would kill you.  No think about all the people in this country already on high doses for years,  the majority is not going to be able to tapper or stop.  Only they are not diabetic and they won't lose consciousness fairly painlessly.  You reduce or limit our meds without medical evidence,  you harm me.  You toucher the 3 strong hard labor working men in my life,  my husband and 2 sons.  I already am completely dependent upon my husband.  My husband and Sons took turns caring for me during last year already,   I could not be alone because I couldn't care for myself.  As of now,  I am able to take small outing and can attend church.

"139","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"To Whom It May Concern:

Please re-consider adopting CDC Guidelines for opoid prescibing as offical policy. The HHS white paper has left out the chronic pain patients of today and tomorrow. 

I have suffered from Peripheral Neuropathy since February 1998. Up until that point, I was in my usual state of very good health, a working mother and wife. Life was very good until I woke one night with horrific burning senasation in my hip and leg. I could barely walk due to the feeling that I was putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. The pressure of wearing clothes sent sent such pain through my legs I was forced to leave the job that I so loved. When summer came and I went outside, the wind touching my legs intensified the pain to such a degree I had to stay indoors or keep my legs covered when I went outside. I never knew such an incidious thing could happen out of nowhere that a gentle summer breeze could possibly cause pain!!

My life went from full time employment, mother and wife to round the clock sobbing in pain. It took slightly less that two years to be diagnosed with a nerve disease I'd never heard of, Idopathic Peripheral Neuropathy. 

In the search for a diagnosis, I underwent steroid injections in my hip for a possible bursitis. I underwent many steroid injections in my back for a supposed pinched nerve in my back. I was prescribed Neurontin which was new on the market of pain management that did offer, finally, a degree of relief. I also had a discectomy to relieve pressure off my sciatic nerve, only for the surgeon to discover after he cut into my back he realized I had no such pinched nerve. 
In that operation, my dura was knicked with a scalpel. Six weeks later I was re-admitted for an emergency surgery to stitch and glue the knick. It was only after this failed operation and six months of suffering that I was prescribed Vicodin.
I was then refered to a pain management clinic when there was ony a few of them in the Chicagoland area. That Dr. recommended a morphine pump. I felt that was a drastic measure for what was still unnamed pain. 

Finally, I saw a neurologist that performed an EMG and diagnosed the PN! It was such a relief to have a name, only to be told, at 41 1/2 years old, that I would never be out of pain again. That neurologist attempted to find relief through many anti-seizure and anti-depressant drugs with very little to no relief as well as an array of side effects from these drugs.

In 2006 I attempted to gain relief through an implanted nerve stimulator. I did get great relief for a the first two weeks on the trial of the device. However, the surgeon was never able to place the unit in the needed spot again and the implant was removed after several months of setting and resetting the device controls.

In June 1999, I was fortunate to tell my story to my clinics new primary care doctor who advised me, for my general health, I could not continue to take 2 Vicodin tabs every four hours and recommended time released morphine. It took a few days for the pain to, once and for all be= controlled! I don't know where I would be these past 19 years without this Dr feeling safe enough to treat at this point-chronic pain. 

I now live in great fear of how these CDC guidelines will affect me and others that come after me. How will the next sufferer survive years and years of unrelenting pain that is considered taboo to treat? Other pain patients I have met online over the years are also living in fear. I am hearing stories of freinds falling ill with one thing or another and being unable to be prescribed anything at all for relief. I believe the ""Turn the Tide"" guidelines are well intended but go too far when it comes to the chronic pain patient as well as brief illnesses that deserve the component of compassion in a modern society. 

Thank you for your consideration, 
Connie Land

I have tried many modalities to help with my pain - surgery, nerve blocks, TENS, implanted nerve stimulator, acupuncture, jin shi jytsu, chiropractic care, lidocaine, supplements, radio frequency ablation, biofeedback, psychotherapy, self-hypnosis, PT, NSAIDS, antidepressants, trigger point injections. However, my pain still requires opioid pain medication to be adequately controlled. 
About 20 years ago my nurse practitioner added gabapentin to my medications and it helped so much that I was able to go to work. Using a combination of opioids and gabapentin, my pain was controlled enough to allow me to go to work part-time as a high school math and physics instructor. That combination of medications and adjunct therapies allowed me to be a useful member of society.
If Medicare refused to pay for my medications I would be unable to work or even cook or shop.  I have always taken my medications exactly as prescribed and taken my pain contract seriously. I submit to monthly UA screens, abstain from alcohol, use only one pharmacy, and secure my medications.  It is unlikely my condition will ever improve, in fact, it is likely to deteriorate. My doctor and I will continue to work to keep my opioid and gabapentin dosage as low as possible while still allowing me to have some quality of life.
The proposed policies are not supported by proven studies. Everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome. 

These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, need for social services, force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.

I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.

My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.

A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.

I live in a rural area and travel an hour and a half to my doctors office. I must find a ride that is willing to take me on a 3-hour round trip to visit my doctor or get prescrotions filled at a pharmacy. A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship and removes the doctors discretion to deal with 

I take Gabapentin and opioids safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed.  If I was unable to take these medications I would likely have to move in with my parents for help with things like preparing meals and cleaning. I would be unable to work.

Opioid prescriptions have decreased for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

"146","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a 40 year old woman with a lifelong disease involving multiple systems of the body. I have been dealing with multiple forms of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome my entire life. However, I was only diagnosed in the last year by a Geneticist, Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, and Osteopathic doctor. As far back as I can remember I have dealt with periods of extreme pain. In the past 6 years my body has deteriorated at a significantly fast rate. I have tried; physical therapy, TENs machines, multiple cortisone and anesthetic injections, psychotherapy, multiple antidepressants,Naltrexone, Gabapentin, and Pregabapentin, acupuncture, acupressure, Osteopathic Manual Manipulation/Treatment, weekly lidocaine injections, mindfulness,  surgeries (4 with 2 directly on the spine over the last 2 years) and limiting painful activities. None of these treatments relieves pain for a significant amount of time even in combination. Unfortunately, relief from pain is most reliable from pain medication. I never wanted to be on these medications, but have only received consistent relief from pain from them. Pain medication in combination with some of these treatments is the only way I can perform the most basic limited activities. I cannot work or drive. I cannot sit ot stand for long periods. I have falls and periods of loss of feeling in body parts. I continue to fight to get as healthy as I can and to function as much as possible. Pain medications give me enough relief to do physical therapy, to attend numerous doctors appointments, and perform basic personal care activities. These are my limited activities with these medications. I have not worked for almost 3 years, I lost bowel and bladder control for awhile and lost feeling in my leg and external genitalia. Can you imagine being in your 30's and not being able to control some of the most basics of bodily control? Imagine getting married and losing all ability to enjoy sex. Pain medications have made it possible to get the surgeries I need to improve my level of functioning. They have allowed me to leave my home for short periods and to be able to regain feelings and control of my bowel and bladder. 
I have both a Bachelors and a Masters Degree in psychology. I follow strict guidelines with all my medications, including my pain medications. I perform pill counts, attend pain medication doctor's appointments, and never let anyone have any of my medications. I am not an addict. I do not get euphoric or ""high"". What I do get is to shower and dress and perform daily activities with assistance.
 I know that there is a national epidemic of both Heroin and Fentanyl use. These drugs are coming from China and Mexico, not from people on pain medication the majority of the time. I want the damage and deaths to end, but more restrictions on pain medications is not the answer. The Medicare limitations will make it difficult if not impossible for older adults, dependent adults, and disabled individuals with Medicare to get the pain relief they need to do the basics of functioning. If you can't leave the home, don't have support, a weekly trip to a pharmacy is impossible. If you are on high levels of pain medications there is a reason for this and lack of these medications will lead to suffering. Ending medications will not in most cases end the pain. Instead people may result to the use of medications obtained illegally. 
If you suffer from chronic pain, a lack of pain medications means being locked in a tortured body suffering constantly. Please continue to be humane in your treatment of those suffering.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0990","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Stacy Brauer, Redmond, WA"

This has allowed me along with exercise and meditation to get out of bed each morning.  I do not abuse the drugs I use.  I still work, make  and design jewelry and trinkets, but without meds will not be able to function at the level I am functioning.  
Only allowing a certain number of pain meds a week or month or requiring prescriptions be filled every week will only make the life of pain patients harder.  Our lives are hard enough.  Most of us wish we did not need these meds.  Many of us have had procedures and surgeries in hope of getting off the pain meds. I have had 6 surgeries and still require meds to function.  I do not rely on pain meds alone.  I attend various exercise classes 3 to 5 times a week, I meditate, try to keep my steess level down, and use various rub on ointments to help ease the pain.  Most chronic pain patients realize the drugs will not rid us of all our pain, but need the meds to keep our pain at a level that will allow us to function.  I worry that if our pain medication is cut back or taken away that many patients with chronic pain will commit suicide or take to the streets to get their drugs.  Chronic pain patients that take opiate drugs are not addicts.  They are like any other ill person that take medicine to control their disease.  Medicare payments toward our medication should not be changed.  In the long run  if our treatment and medication is not overseen by our doctors but instead is controlled by Medicare I see a disaster that will cost Medicare much more than it is costing them now.  Also, this will not save life's.  This will destroy the lives of chronic pain patients.  The chronically ill should not be who the government goes after in it's war on drugs.  They should be going after those drug cartels shipping the illegal drugs into our country.  They should be going after those that sell the illegal drugs that are shipped here.  I understand that those that have not experienced living with chronic pain do not get it.  All I can say is that they should spend a day or two walking in my shoes.

I am as judicious as I can be with pain medication because rather than worrying about addiction in my case, I become very constipated to the point of bleeding and another layer of agony.  If I do not have my medication, life is almost unlivable.  I become totally incapacitated both mentally and physically.

"160","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been a Medicare patient suffering from Peripheral Neuropathy and a number of other ailments for over a decade. After having tried every other option available to me short of amputating limbs, I am finally able to function to some extent on what some might consider a large dose of OxyContin. For more than ten years, I have always followed the rules. I have taken only the dose prescribed by my doctor. I have never asked for an early refill, or had my meds lost or stolen. I have never had any interaction with Law Enforcement that had anything to do with my medication.

It is currently very difficult to fill the prescriptions I have for opiates. I often make several trips to the pharmacy, because they are not allowed to keep enough of my medication to always fill it when due. If they don't fill it, I suffer horrible withdrawal. If they fill a partial script, then I have to go back to my doctor to explain why he has to do extra paperwork and write more scripts to make up for what the pharmacy didn't have available. I have to go back to my insurance carrier and get waivers to approve a second prescription in a month. It costs me money. It costs my doctor money. It costs the insurance carrier money. And it costs the govenment money. 

The current wave of hysteria has caused my doctor to reduce my dosage somewhat already, entirely out of fear. From this experience I can say that if I lose access to the opioids that I have safely and responsibly taken for a decade, I will have two choices: I can find an illegal source to relieve my pain, or I can commit suicide. There is no third option. I cannot live a life filled with torture. In contemplating the likelihood that it will become impossible to treat my pain -- because of shortsighted legislation such as this -- I have begun to put my affairs in order at age 57. 

I can tell you that I am not alone. More of this type of regulation, regardless of whatever misguided good intent is behind it, will have the exact opposite effect than what is intended. Law abiding patients will have no choice but to turn to illegal drugs, increasing the amount of thefts, diversion, and other criminal activity. That is, of course, only the patients who don't commit suicide. There will be many.

I absolutely support prosecuting and jailing those involved in illicit drugs, but legitimate patients need to be protected from well-meaning but ultimately deadly witch hunts.

This is archaic medicine and does more harm than one can imagine. Physicians are afraid to treat patients who are victims of pain. The DEA targets them and instills fear in how they choose to treat their patients and what they prescribe. More and more, doctors are refusing to treat their patients who have chronic pain. Patients are far too often considered ""Malingering"" or ""Doctor Shopping"". This proposed change will exacerbate this problem.

The DEA, HHS, private insurers, and now CMS are pursuing policies and restrictions that will cause harm and suffering to millions of people. What do you say to a chronic pain patient that has responsibly used these medications, never abused them, gets only relief from pain, doesn't sell pills, and doesn't use illicit drugs? What do you say to me?

Because of the short-sighted government policies and lawsuits fueled by unbridled greed, I and millions of legitimate pain patients are now treated like criminals, subjected to urinalysis tests that cost thousands, frequent physician visits that cost hundreds monthly in copays and deductibles, pill counts that are demeaning, and persistent questioning from pharmacists. You are complicit in the pain, suffering, and documented damage that will result.

Look at the data. Everyone - even the most ardent anti-opiate groups such as PROP - now agrees that the current ""crisis"" is fueled by ILLICIT fentanyl from China and Mexico. Less that 1% of legitimate pain patients develop a substance use disorder. Overdoses, particularly those in the media such as Tom Petty and Prince, have been documented to be caused by polypharmacy and illicit opioids. They are not caused by legally prescribed and responsibly used medications.

The zealotry caused by this hysteria is not affecting post-surgical care. Patients are being told to ""take a Tylenol"". Is this the care you would want for you or your family? Ask Rep. Scalise. Was he told to ""take a Tylenol""? Or was he given proper, compassionate pain management? Is this another example of a dual system of medical care?

Please consider the impacts of what you are doing. Be accountable. Talk to chronic pain patients. Talk to the experts who bravely continue to treat them.

Thank you for your consideration.

My husband has suffered with spinal stenosis for years; he is in his 50's and has been permanently disabled and placed on Medicare. He has been to doctors, sent to pain clinics where he had shots injected into his spine that they swore would help the pain and when that failed, he was sent to see a surgeon. He's been told that surgery might or might not help; the surgeon gave him a 50/50 percentage that having surgery would land him in a wheel chair permanently. Also, he was told that  surgery would not take away the pain, all it would do is stop the numbness he gets in his feet. At that time, his doctor prescribed Oxycod/Acetaminophen 10-325MG every 6 hours; it's not an ongoing prescription, when he runs low, he has to call the doctor for a new one. Because he has been worried of becoming addicted to pain medication, he only takes a dose at night so he can sleep and his prescriptions last longer than one month and she knows that too. He doesn't partake of alcohol because of the drug as he knows and understands that the two don't mix well. As far as being productive goes, there are not many days when he can do very much; he used to enjoy cooking, but now standing and cooking puts him in so much pain that I wake up at night to him moaning in his sleep.  His doctor should be left in charge of making medical care decisions concerning his health because she knows what testing he's had done and she understands what he is dealing with. His treatment shouldn't be left up to Medicare or someone who has never seen him, much less understands what he deals with. If Medicare stops paying for his pain medication and we have to start paying for it outright, I don't know how we be able afford it as neither of us can work; I draw social security and he draws social security disability so we have a very limited income.  Also, I have issues with my hands and I have days when I can't do the things that I normally would and he takes care of me.  If Medicare should stop paying and we can't afford his medication, he would no longer be able to do that because he would be basically reduced to his recliner, more so than he is now.

Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare...
Potential New Measure for 2020 and Beyond (Part C)
I agree that a new assessment plan for care of people with multiple high-risk chronic conditions in part C of the Medicaid cost would decrease treatment if caught earlier. A study of federal data by Avalere Health, funded by America's Health Insurance Plans, found that the risk-adjustment model used by the CMS low balls the cost of treating chronic pain by $14.3 billion, osteoarthritis by $13.4 billion, depression by $8.9 billion and rheumatoid arthritis by $5.3 billion (Dickerson, 2016). With the cost being extreme for a client having one of these conditions, the cost of multiple high-risk chronic condition is unimaginable. Something has to be done. Better assessments and family history should be considered.  If most chronic illness is determined for these clients after emergency room visits, as stated, adding the components of physical function assessment, cognitive function assessment, pain assessment, fall risk assessment, goals of care discussion, and advance care planning would improve clients access to treatment. Clients would be diagnosis or given the tools for prevention. Clients would not have to rely on fee-for-service and Medicare plans can tailor care coordination and disease management programs that allow beneficiaries to better manage chronic conditions (Dickerson, 2016). This would lower the cost of chronic conditions with long term treatment. If chronic conditions are caught earlier and treatment is tailored to the clients, hopefully the need for long term treatment would not be as costly. Understanding this is a small part of the possible change, my support goes to increasing assessments for our ageing population. Thank you for reviewing my comment.

"172","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As a patient who has suffered with Peripheral Neuropathy since 1998, I am very concerned that doctors are being forced to return to the days of undertreatment of pain. I consider myself fortunate to have become disabled by pain at a time when, through education and listening, Drs became unafraid to treat me. I believe it was through the pain communities speaking up that something had to be done, that we DO have medicine the soothe the evils of unmitigated, torturing pain. And to withhold that medication would be unconscionable. To allow the payers to hold the purse strings to relief, well that is just plain wrong in my experience.
 
The sickest, weakest and most economically disadvantaged in our society will be hurt the most by what appears to be, upcoming changes to the treatment of pain. Those that can afford it will simply purchase medication on the black market. I believe the black market for that group will always be available. It is us that have been forced to rely on our insurance companies that will suffer greatly.  

The 90 milligrams maximum is incorrect in assuming all pain is the same. I, too, never knew that pain could be so unrelenting until it happened to me. I am guilty of thinking people were getting high from their supposed needed medications until out of nowhere I was struck with burning pain in my sciatic nerve that without medication my life would be unbearable.  

We've already begun to return to the days of undertreatment of pain as the pain management doctor that gave me so much relief for 10 years with his massive education and trainded hand in administring injections and medication prescribing abandoned me in 2016 when the CDC released medication guidelines. 

In an interview he gave several years ago, he said he went into pain management because he saw that it was a course of treatment that he could offer treatment to his suffering patients the most quickly. He then decided that the red tape and fear just wasn't worth it to him anymore I suppose. He didn't offer me an answer the day he figured how much relief I would be offered on a calculator. He simply advised me that the next month would be my last perscription from him. 

Several weeks into my forced titration, I was fortunate enough to loacte another doctor willing to take me on after reading my medical records, going through my very long history of surgeries, medications and treatments in an attempt to alleviate my suffering. But he has now warned me that we are at the end of days of relief. That CMS, the guidance for all other insurers, is going to take a brand new approach. That no longer will I have a semblence of a normal life. I am afraid. I am very afraid. It does not matter that I have followed all the rules. My Dr has warned me there will nowhere to turn after CMS speaks. 

Please consider the patients of today and tomorrow and reconsider the upcoming archeaic measures. There are real people behind the numbers, and the next one to come down with severe pain could be any of your loved ones. Wouldn't you want them to have ALL options of care open to them? Please don't tie our doctors hands to be able use their education and judgement to relieve suffering you may know nothing about.

"175","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am an educated, engaged, and active great-grandmother.  Most of this is due to a combination of pain medications that have been carefully titrated to be effective for my multiple chronic pain conditions.  I currently survive with a combination of gabapentin, methadone, and norco that lets me get out of bed each day and make it through most days without having to go to the ER or remain bedbound.  This combination of medications were arrived at over 15 years of suffering daily, intractable pain and suffering to the point of remaining suicidal for many years.  I am finally stable enough to have a life again, but only because I am followed by a  pain management team of an MD, physical therapist, and psychologist all trained in pain management.  I know at this point in my life, my fibromyalgia, degenerative disk disease throughout my cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, severe osteoporosis including several fractures in my neck and back, and frequent injections due to impinged nerves, would leave me no other choice than suicide if my medications were reduced any further (I am already at 90 mme of opioids due to previous reductions).  I literally cannot live if my pain level does not remained controlled.  I have spent months and years in severe pain over the last 30 years and do not hesitate to say, I cannot tolerate it any further.  I do not drink, so have never mixed my pain meds with alcohol and never will.  I have never used more pain meds than prescribed and so far have complied with all the reductions my physician tells me he had to make because he is afraid of the 
CDC and losing his license.  If a pain management physician feels this way, how do you think his patients feel.

Making arbitrary guidelines on pain patients will not stop people from overdosing on opiates or other drugs that they were never prescribed, and obtained through illicit channels.  Studies show that only a very small percentage of individuals who overdose on opiates were ever prescribed the drugs.  Rather, they buy them on the black market through misdirection of the drugs at the manufacturer, not through their own prescriptions.  Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.

I am a Medicare patient and am absolutely opposed to further reductions in necessary and appropriate medications for chronic pain patients like myself.  Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

"179","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns. There are so meny issues pretaining to the heroin/fentanyl epidemic. Some folks who are ill with painful , incurable disease, have been victimized by the unrelenting  hype. Created by overzealous individuals, who have had the lose of a loved one. It's so hard to realize the importance of taking personal responcability. Not by the ones who are left to grieve. But those who made choices to give in to behavior that was
for non medical purposes. I have an example I'd like to share;   Lets say a man gets or is given a gun to protect his family. And this man has a dispute with another man. Allowing himself to become angrier & angrier rather than being rational. As he gives in to irrational thinking, he makes a life altering decision.
Confronting amd shooting the man he was angry with. 
What happens next? Is the gun arrested or the man? Ridiculous right? The gun didn't kill, the man did. It's the same concept with medication. Taking responcability for ones actions. There are people in this world who take advantage of any opportunities to get high! And take no responsibility for their actions 
In such a situation as this, would it be fair to take everyones gun because one or more were irresponsible? One more example please; diabetics who are insulin dependent need to use hypodermic needles. There are many who are addicted to drugs who also use hypodermic needles. Would it be right to take hypodermic needles. away from diabetics, because others failed to be responcable?","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0435","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","GA"
"180","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"After 29 years of Service to my Country, injured in Vietnam, exposure to Agent Orange and being rated in the US Coast Guard of being exposed to heavy metal poisoning I lived lifestyle that didn't include any drugs except when authorized by Doctors for surgeries after the fact.In spite of injuries from 1969, being on active duty one needed to have a clear mind. 
In US Coast Guard I flew on and maintained fixed wing and rotary aircraft for 17 1/2 years and occasionally was injured during routine maintenance, was electrocuted while working on Radar system and exposed to 1,1,1 Trichorflorethane, a not then known carcinogen used for cleaning avionics equipment. 
I was also in the first class of Sensor System Operators who's sole function was to intercept drug laden aircraft from Colombia with covert surveillance and coordinating DEA and Customs and other assets to intercept illegal drops. This was also done with ships carrying known illegal drugs or immigrants, as well as normal Search and Rescue Ops from Puerto Rico to Alaska.
Retired in 1997 I started a new career in Law Enforcement, but it was cut short by a car crash which killed  my Daughter, and re aggravated old injuries from Vietnam.
My Daughter was brought back to life although she suffered extensive physical damage and was dead over 6 to 8 minutes, going from an honor student to graduating with a GED. I spent thousands of dollars getting her treated for drug abuse during a time when she normally would be prepping to go to college.
I was in so much pain that I had to quit my job and was unemployed for nine months. Finally my oldest Daughter drove me to the VA Hospital where I was assessed for serious injuries and placed on MSContin, IRMorphine, Clonazepam and Temazepam which I used from 1999 to 2016. Since I was a Single Father, this allowed me to help raise both of my Children and live a fairly normal life. My last hurdle was finding out I had type one Hepatitis C which forced me to quit a job I enjoyed very much, which was working a computer help desk. I had plans of going into network engineering and wanted to specialize in PC security.
As I got older I found the amount of pain was aggravated by the heat and humidity of where I lived and decided to move to a colder climate which helped. With the help of a new Pharmacist at the VA Clinic I was going to in Montana I was able to get on Harvoni and get rid of my Hepatitis C within two months. I was walking 2 miles daily, and started taking a foreign language and Systematic Theology courses online as I am active in my Church.
One thing I still had issues with was both knees and both shoulders.
I was given many steroid shots with Lidocaine in my left shoulder and eventually my rotator cuff separated. In 2015 I was seen by a good  Orthopedic Clinic using VA Choice who ended up operating on my left ulnar nerve, releasing it from a sheath that gave it a little more room to loosen up. However it was pinched off around my neck and after some relief it started to continue to hurt badly.
On January of 2016 I was forced to taper off the amount of medication I was taking and was also forced to sign a much harsher contract. As a result I became bedridden and am getting 1 to 2 hours of sleep a night.I am awakened by sharp pain in my neck, left arm and both shoulders and knees and my cervical and lower back.
Requesting to see a Neurosurgeon in the City closest to where I lived who was friends with my PCP(Primary Care Physician). The Neurosurgeon required a letter from my PCP before I could see him. I wanted to get surgery I knew would help ease the pain needed on my cervical area that would relieve the sharp pain that was going down my left arm.
The Neurosurgeon finally saw me with updated MRI's and told me ""The amount of pain killers I would need to fix your issue would probably kill you. So my advice is to get off all drugs and then come back and see me.""
What you are proposing now would limit me to even more severe pain than I'm already in. I am currently taking 90 mg of MSContin twice daily and the proposal to limit this to 90mg will only continue to deteriorate my medical condition.
I served my Country and risked my life for a career that promised me help for my sacrifice, but instead has turned into an abandonment by the very government I served, being blamed for the ""Opioid Crisis"", and being ignored by the very same government that gives better treatment to street junkies than to those of us seriously injured for life.
I don't get ""high"" from what I normally used, & if offered pot I would refuse it. If I did not need the pain killers I'd never use them but the pain gets worse as I age. To pass this law will only result in more prolonged suffering and more suicides from those who cannot handle the pain. I will die from a heart attack, having had one before when I misplaced a bottle of Clonazepam and was left with no help from the VA for one month, suffering one then.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0987","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Steven Pitkin, MT"
"181","CMS",FALSE,2,NA,NA,"I am a chronic/intractable pain patient, a pain patient advocate, and an Ambassador for Chronic Disease Coalition. I have had chronic/intractable pain for almost twenty years, suffering with endometriosis, ilioinguinal neuralgia, spinal stenosis, and DDD. I am permanently disabled and without cure. I am left with only palliative care, managing my pain. Since the ""opioid crisis"", my pain relief was forcibly reduced, and has been left undertreated. Therefore, I am left to live with what was once a symptom, but has now become a disease of its own, chronic pain disorder. My central nervous system has been changed by high levels of cortisol and nociception, causing high blood pressure, tachycardia, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and neurodegenerative problems. Most importantly, I have a profound loss of function from the forced reduction and a much lower quality of life. My heart breaks because I can no longer attend my child's school events or care for my family or home as I am mostly bedridden/housebound. There is a profound loneliness that happens when a pain patient can no longer socialize with their family and community due to undertreated pain. Things will only get worse for patients like me, stable for years on the same dose of opioid therapy, because of a scientifically unfounded threshold. 

As most patients, I use a multimodal approach to pain management, including a spinal cord stimulator and meditation, but the therapy that has overwhelmingly worked best for me is opiate therapy, considered with this petition to be over the arbitrary, unfounded limit. It is difficult to get access to the medications my physician, a respected board-certified pain medicine and anesthesiologist, needs me on now. When I spoke with him, he told me, as a physician, he is ""under immense pressure"" to conform to 90MME, and how dangerous these arbitrary caps on pain relief can be for patients like me, who have been in good standing with him and stable for the last seventeen years.  

An arbitrary cap like 90MME is dangerous to patients. Patients are given opioids as a last resort, titrated to analgesic effect. By removing physician discretion from this equation, we are removing an imperative part of the doctor-patient relationship, trust. I am astounded by the sheer number of patients I speak to daily as an advocate, stable on opioids for years, forcibly reduced or removed. These patients are faced with living in debilitating pain, going to the streets, or as many patients have had to choose, suicide. I am appalled at the increasing number of patient suicides from pain that are happening in the U.S. since the CDC Guidelines have been enforced as law across all specialties of physicians, including pain management. Patients have lost jobs and houses and now on our already overburdened federal assistance programs. Further blocking access to individualized, patient-centered opioid therapy with this petition would be catastrophic to the already damaged pain patient community. 

It is clear the scientific data and clinical evidence do not support any definitive dosage or duration threshold for addiction or overdose. The dosage and duration limits proposed by CMS are not supported by any sound scientific data and support a one-size-fits-all approach to prescribing. This approach would be problematic and inconsistent with the need for individualized, patient-centered treatment and the variability among patient responses to opioids. Physicians have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the individual patient at all times, and that the interests of the patient are to be held above all others, including those of the state. It is imperative for physicians to have the discretion when deciding with their patients to titrate dosage to analgesic effect that they not out of fear modify their treatment in an attempt to avoid regulatory attention. Fear of regulatory scrutiny of prescribing practices for opioid analgesics will undoubtedly drive treatment plans if these kinds of arbitrary binary scientifically unfounded thresholds become law. The persistence of irrational and unsubstantiated fears about addiction, morbidity thresholds, and adverse side effects of opioid analgesics have already grossly eroded the doctor-patient relationship.  

Pharmacogenetics has shown patients need certain genes to metabolize certain opioids, and there's great variability and fallibility in the morphine milligram equivalent calculations, which clearly do not take into account patient weight, tolerance, or genetic makeup, all exceedingly crucial in determining which opioid and dosage will achieve desired analgesic effects. Hindering this critical process would not only put the patient at significant risk for degenerative effects of undertreated pain, but also encourage physicians to forcibly taper or abandon patients. 
Granting any of these changes, arbitrary dosage thresholds or duration limits of pain relief will be catastrophic to patients and inhumane.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0956","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Stacey Turiello-IL"

"183","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Please do not move forward with the plan to deny coverage for all patients on  >90 mg for opioid pain management. This is an arbitrary number that no one but an individual patient and their doctor can decide upon.

With fear of losing their licenses, doctors are already refusing to prescribe helpful medication, under medicating or tapering their patients who are cursed with debilitating physical issues; illness or disease. Many chronic pain patients are suffering with forced tapering of their pain medications or aren't receiving therapeutic doses. Some, so desperate that they can no longer function due to tapering have committed suicide.

At last MRI a couple of years ago, I had herniated and leaky discs and stenosis and arthritis. My strength and the burning pain continues.. My once very active lifestyle is now very limited. I can't walk too far, or freely play around with my grandchild. I can't sleep on my bed anymore and have a contraption of large U shaped pillows braced against the back of my couch. I have to travel for a couple of overnights in a month and am already trying to figure out how in the world I'll be able to function.

Although my surgeon suggested a fusion, 2 other doctors felt it was best that in my case the outcome may not make things any better. I have had epidurals, nerve blocks, physical therapy, massage, biofeedback therapy and have tried with all my might to fight through now varying degrees of pain with nsaids and a low dose of tramadol. I did not tolerate gabepentin or lyrica and was too knocked out to function with several types of muscle relaxers. I know from experience, that if I were to take a low dose of vicoden, even if only when the pain is nauseating that I could be more active, but my doctors will no longer prescribe it. I've been told that my condition will not get better and it is upsetting to know that there is medication that would relieve the sometimes incapacitating pain but neither my primary care doctor or previous pain center were willing to help with what had worked in the past.

Doctors went into the business of helping humanity and now, in so many instances, they are unwilling or say they are unable to do what they think is appropriate. (due to government overreach) Having an insurance company or government agency tell a doctor how to do their job is causing a crisis separate and apart from this current opioid crisis. From my understanding, this opioid crisis has everything to do with Illicit fentanyl, heroin and addicts who are dying by mixing sometimes legal and often illegal substances. Pain patients are not addicts and they are suffering. 

Chronic pain patients, some stable for years under the care of their own doctors are being left in the dust because of addicts getting illicit drugs off the street. I don't believe the percentage of those with addiction has gone up. It is inhumane to know that some government agency is scaring doctors out of caring for patients who have needed whatever their dose may be; scaring doctors to cut doses to some arbitrary limit. It is inhumane to know that through no fault of their own, patients are treated like criminals, needing to give urine tests and pill counts just to retain their best quality of life. Please stop scaring doctors and patients with what appears in the public to be flawed data. Graphs and data I've seen indicate a very large drop in pain medication prescriptions and a large increase in opiate deaths. Let doctors monitor appropriate dosing of medication for their individual patients without fear of reprisal. 

Please don't forget that patients want the ability to have a meaningful and active quality of life. I miss my old, active life. It is beyond upsetting to know that the low doses of medication that helped me be more productive in the past, are now unavailable to me due to the doctors fear. I pay the price with a more sedentary lifestyle. I don't look forward to a future of worsening issues with no relief in sight. I can't imagine the horror for those with more intractable pain than I, losing what works for them because of this potential change. Please, Please listen to the patients and their doctors regarding the proposed arbitrary dosing on pain medication limits. It just doesn't make sense.

The last issue  of ""guidelines"", which included the 90-120 MME's in 2016-2017, effectively deprived my husband of needed care--reduced his functionality to 1-2 from an 8, took away his ability to work, and raised his constant pain from a 4 to a 9-10 on bad days.  Doctors' fear of appearing to be enablers has led in my husband's experience to loss of trust and mutually respectful relationship between him and any primary care providers, loss of care--specifically pain relief, and increase in his  sense of hopelessness and severe, possibly irreversible physical deterioration, especially his fitness, that is inextricably linked to his quality of life.  

This is the shotgun approach to medicine--believing that all patients should respond the same way to all medications and all dosages and have equal tolerance for alternative medications and procedures.  This is nonsense.  My husband, for example, cannot safely take anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and is severely limited to the amount of Tylenol his liver can process.  So much for the advice to ""just take aspirin."" Alternatives to prescription and non-prescription drugs--acupuncture, physical therapy, massage, spinal injections, do offer small, peripheral relief, but access is either limited or not included at all in insurance coverage and are therefore basically beyond the means of many retirees (including us) on Social Security.  The experiment with potentiator drugs such as Lyrica and Neurontin in our case were 1) completely ineffective as pain relief agents and 2) dangerous in that they led to mental issues.  Moreover, these drugs also involve dependency and can cause harm if discontinued suddenly.  In any event, no specialists have indicated that any of these alternatives will restore capability to enjoy a full or even significant part of his former daily activity.  Accept less is the new mantra.

The idea of a 7-day emergency supply of opioids has a major flaw.  Those of us in rural communities with limited numbers of medical resources would LOVE to have access to a physician within 7 days to gain an exception to the 90 MME rule!  Add to this the lack of desire for local doctors to even see patients who need pain medication and you have a new twist to the denial of care crisis.

The rules proposed by the CMS are unnecessary (how many seniors on long term regular medication are part of the opioid crisis, after all), cruel, inflexible, and discriminatory against seniors.  They confuse dependence with addiction.  They assume all pain patients taking opioids are unable to responsibly take their medications. They threaten to throw individuals with complex, chronic, incurable, and degenerative medical conditions into the cold with no resources to support and/or improve their quality of life.  There are days my husband bemoans the fact that, having made life nearly unendurable, the same medical system does nothing to help end his--and others'--suffering humanely.  I submit that this is not a desirable consequence for us and the other millions of Medicare patients seeking long-term and therapeutically effective care for their pain.

Eliminating pain medication for me, and those like me, will have a negative impact on our quality of life, make us less able to function, and have us in doctor's offices and emergency rooms much more frequently. Addicts will just find another addiction (I hear many of already moved on to other meds), but those with chronic pain will suffer. 

Limiting the amount of opioids we can get will also add additional trips to the pharmacy and more co-pays, neither of which the chronically ill can handle. Doctors need to be the ones making decisions for their patients and patients need to take respiratory for their lives. I have never received a bottle of opioids without warning labels abd detailed information about addiction. The bottles of alcohol don't even come with these warnings, yet we have alcoholics everywhere. It's been made very clear that opioids are addictive and they shouldn't be taken away from people who need them because others don't follow directions.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0620","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Marcia Frost-IL"

"198","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have private insurer which often follows Medicare policies.
I am a pain patient diagnosed with spondylitis many years. I also now have neuropathy more in my legs.  I tried essential oils, Tylenol , ibuprofen, ginger, turmeric, and various other natural remedies. Now I'm on Tramadol, cyclobenzpren, and gabapentin. Im 5 months post op from a fusion and decompression. I go to physical therapy 2 times a week and have a home program as well. Prior to surgery I had 8 months of physical therapy. I spend most of my physical therapy being realignment on the spine, pelvic amd cocex areas. I have been given TENs and ice during PT. At home besides trying natural remedies and the medicine pain plan, I have a Tens massage unit, and alternate heat and ice. I have already had 2 spinal cortisone injections and 1 course of oral steroids this year as well. With all of that you'd think I would improve,  but they all failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and do day-to-day activities like; working a full-time job, chores around my house since I live alone, care and visits for an adult I'm legal guardian for, spending some time with friends, working out on my PT program so not to deteriorate more. 

If Medicare/Medicaid/private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME/any dosage I wil lose your job, income, home, car, entertainment, not be able to care for family/house, etc. I've already had to use intermittent FMLA and State FMLA in the last few months. On days the pain is so bad I barely can walk. I fight horrible pain leg numbness, and the nauseous feeling a lot of the days. I try to stay away from the stronger medicine as ling as I can; even though it takes away more of my quality of life.

I'm not only under the care of the surgeon who did my spine surgery, but also a pain management doctor. I receive all my prescriptions for the pain snd neuropathy from the pain management doctor. I use only 1 pharmacy to fill those prescriptions. I don't drink and take my medication. I surely don't sell them because 1 it's illegal 2 I need them and 3 I'd like to keep my job. 

Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome. These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services. Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues. I still see in my head 1 suicide note someone left after he couldn't take the pain any longer.

I am currently disabled by definition , NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.
My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare/private insurance. A 7 day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.
A 7 day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.

I take the prescribed gabapentin, Tramadol, and cyclobenzpr safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed.

Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.
We need an exemption for legacy patients already stable on dosages above 90 MME - MOST IMPORTANT.

This is the Medicare Part D program, you have an extremely diverse, and medically ""complex"" series of patient's in your Part D program's. They often have a variety of complex pain issue's and are rightfully & legitimately on ""Higher dose's"" of opiate medication's. The CDC Guidelines were ""Voluntary"" Guidelines for Non-pain physician's to utilize as a ""guide"" when prescribing, or using opiate type medication's. I also must note those ""Voluntary guidelines"" were not written by ""Pain specialists"". They were written by people who have never even treated pain patient's, or dealt with their complexities, and quite frankly, they do not know what it is like to be on the ""front lines"". You must take this factor into account..

The 90 Mg ""MME"" Morphine Equivalency is not backed up by any scientifical data. Where this may be an ""appropriate guideline"" to follow with any ""New"" or ""opiate naive"" patients, this is not a ""guideline"" that should be followed with ""every single patient"". There are patient's that are ""opiate tolerant"" meaning they have been on opiate medications for many years, 90 Mg ""MME"" Morphine Equivalency will not work well, if at all to control any type of pain. There is also patient's that have a medical condition's that effects how their body will process, and metabolize opiate type medication's, there are many different variables that can affect how any one ""individual person"" metabolizes opiate type medication's. 

However, one big factor in particular is the CYP450 also known as they ""Cytochrome P450"" respectively. This ""Enzyme System"" can affect how any one patient's body ""processes"" opiate medication's, and it varies a great deal from each individual person. There is poor, normal, rapid, and ultra rapid metabolizers respectively. These patient's that are seen as receiving ""high dose's"" of opiates often may have a ""defect"" in how their body metabolize's opiate medication's. This is not something any patient has control over, and they should not be denied opiate medication's at doses greater than 90 Mg Morphine Equvialency based on this fact. It is astounding that medical data, and scientific facts that we know are ""factual"" and have been researched are not being considered at all when these ""guidelines"" are wrote for physician's to consider, and use in clinical practice. 

It is not as simple as to say every single patient receiving opiate medications is to receive no more than ""X"" amount of any opiate. It does not work this way. It would be nice if every patient responded the same to these medication's, and we could say we know for a fact that ""X"" amount will work to reduce pain in everyone. However, this is only in a ""Very idealized and perfect world."" We know that this is ""grossly"" wrong and to put these kind's of mandates and dose restriction's into place is ""grossly negligent"" and quite ""cruel"" treatment of anyone who is in need of opiate type medication's for chronic pain. This kind of mandate being put into the Part D program's will not fix the opiate ""epidemic"".

You are putting these patient's at a very increased risk of having to endure immediate, harsh, and inhumane dose taper's. They will end up being turned away without their medication's at pharmacies creating an immediate need for the prescribing physician to respond to the issue before the patient is left to go into precipitated withdrawals. Physician's are not equipped to be able to respond immediately on issue's like these that require an extreme amount of attention often times resulting in an hour, or more on the phone trying to straighten out the insurance denial with the pharmacy, and insurance companies. Even after these efforts are made by the prescribing physician the patient may be left without their needed medication's. There is no guarantee that they will receive the doses they were prescribed, and needed. Pain patient's are often prescribed a ""long-term"" Opiate, and a ""short-term"" opiate for their daily pain needs. If this mandate is put into effect they will automatically be ""over"" the 90 mg Morphine Equivalency based on this alone.

I urge you to take all these thing's into effect before putting this as a ""mandate"" into the Part D program. I would understand the need for ""Initial OR NEW"" Opiate prescriptions having a 90 mg ""MME"" Morphine equivalency cutoff with a 7 Day Supply limit or even if the patient was found to have Multiple Physician's, and Pharmacies. 

However, Please make an ""Exception to Exclude"" Long term Chronic Pain Patient's on stable dose's that are not ""New"" or receiving an opiate prescription for the ""first time"". As the Long term Chronic Pain Patient's are the ones who this ""90 mg Morphine Equivalency, and 7 days supply limit mandate is going to dramatically, and negatively impact leaving these patients without their needed medication's.

"210","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am and have been a chronic pain patient with the same pain management doctor for close to 10years, I am also intermittently on Medicaid depending on how much I can work to support my family. My husband and I have 4 children ages 19 to 13months. 10 years ago after several accidents I went to the emergency room believing I had a broken shoulder. After the last serious sports related accident I thought that my shoulder would eventually heal on it's own, as it always had before; but after over 3months had passed and my pain level had progressed to the point I was unable to sleep more than an hour or two at a time, as well as being brought to tears several times a day from doing simple daily tasks I became increasingly convinced that a bone break must have happened. It just simply was not healing and was progressively getting worse almost weekly. At the emergency room they did x-rays and I was told nothing was wrong with my shoulder but that my neck had severe, long term, permanent damage that had progressed to the point of feeling like a broken shoulder or collerbone. I was told to go back to my primary care doctor, which I did, she referred me to a neurosurgeon and my current pain management doctor. I was sent for various additional testing including several MRI's (my pain management doctor did not think the extensive damage was possible at my age and requested a second opinion, which confirmed and expounded on the first assessment), CT scans and additional x-rays The neuronsurgeon was unable to provide any type of permanent solution via surgery due to the degenerative nature of my injuries, he could not make a recommendation which would correct the damage. Before being prescribed opioid medication I'd tried physical therapy, yoga, herbal and holistic treatments, many ablation treatments and everything my pain management doctor recommended. 

Amerigroup does not pay their providers in my area and has not made a single payment to my pain management doctor for over 4 years. My doctor will no longer accept Amerigroup and there is no other pain management doctor in my area that will either, they simply do not ever get paid. Due to this I've had to sell every bit of personal items possible including nonessential clothing to pay my monthly pain management visit. I currently have an outstanding balance equal to 3 monthly visits that I just simply cannot pay. Without this medication at the level it is today I would not be able to work or take care of my children and would essentially be bedridden. I would not have any hope of being able to continue seeing my pain management doctor and would be forced to resort to emergency room visits that would never be paid for. Over a year ago my breakthrough pain medication amount and dosage was drastically cut due to my doctors fear of repercussions from this new war on opioids. Since that cut I've had to reduce my hours at work and accept less physically demanding work with a dramatic loss of income. My family and I are on the brink of homelessness. I want to work, I love my job but I simply cannot get through consequentative days at work. I have a literal hunchback at the age of 41 due to the progression of my injuries. Standing, carrying anything or even sitting at a desk for 2 or more days in a row results in a horrible, painful soreness, always accompanied by a multiple day severe migraine type headache due to permanently contracted muscles contracting further and compressing nerves. After 2-3 days of near 24hr bed rest the muscles will eventually relax enough for the migraine to slowly subside to a deep, dull, ache which makes moving very painful but not impossible. Any further reduction in opioid medication would be devastating for my family.

If these proposed changes are approved the little I'm able to currently do will be reduced to 24/7 bed rest. Work will be out of the question and I will become even more of a burden to the Government. My children need their mother to be present, they need me to be able to participate in activities like going to the park, library and community events, keeping my home clean and safe, attending to their daily needs which would all be greatly reduced with the passing of this proposal; even more would fall to my husband who is already completely overloaded trying to compensate for my shortcomings due to my injuries. I would love to be able to teach my younger kids to do things like ski and camp as I did with my older kids but that won't happen, with the help of my medication at the level it's currently at I can at least participate in activities that require little physical exertion. 

Requesting an exemption to the proposed changes presents a financial burden my family simply cannot sustain, we cannot afford my monthly doctor visit at $125 in addition to my medication costs of around $400 a month while waiting for approval or appeal. At the very least a Grandfather clause must be made for existing patients. Thank you.

She hates that she has to take them but because she does, she is able to take care of me, my sister, my dad and herself. When her doctors start giving her less, she lays in bed all day crying and hurting. The increase in overdoses is mostly due to synthetic heroin and fentanyl that comes from China. I feel terrible for the people that get addicted to them. Please target the drug dealers and the addicts but leave my mom alone. She takes her medicine just like her doctor tells her to. Her other insurance company just started requiring preauthorizations for one of her opioids that she has been taking for years. This costs time and money and delays my mom getting her medicine. Please stop hurting my mom. I want her to live to see me graduate from college, get married and have a family. Her doctors say she could live a long time but she won't without opioids.

These are husbands, wives, teachers, employees, mothers, fathers, even people you talk and deal with every day. None of the laws you have enacted to date have stopped the war on drugs. It will not stop until the drugs are no longer available from over the border. 99.9 % of chronic pain patients do not abuse, sell or give their medication away. The laws you are putting into effect are only hurting this community and doing nothing to stop all the drug over doses. This community does not deserve to be treated this way. We have a right to patient care and treatment. People whom have chronic pain cannot drive to the doctor as often as you want them too, they have a hard time just getting out of bed. Most of these laws come from people who have no link to treating chronic pain patients, no one who treats pain patients is on the board who make these laws. No one on the board has the insight needed to make these laws. I understand the drug issue, but these laws you are making are only hurting the people whom need these medications, and it is not helping stop the over doses. Please for the love of God, stop hurting us. It is a life and death issue for us, without the medication to allow us not to live with torture every day we are killing ourselves as there is no alternative that works. Anti-depressants, don't work, alternative care does not work PT does not work. WE have all tried all there is to try and this is our last resort. And you are making us choose between horrible pain, or death. Many people have already committed suicide rather than live with the pain that these new laws have left them in. These are people who were able to function, work, live be father, mothers, spouses.....Patients are responsible for their own actions as are the people who decide to overdoses. It is their actions, they make that decision, so why is the pain community suffering for their actions. This is not fair nor is it the answer to this issue. As you can well see it is not working. Over doses are still up, they get the drug off the street, not from chronic pain patients, from over the border, Heroin is much cheaper and easier to get then prescription drug. The drug problem is coming over the border, it is not the doctors whom treat pain patients. Very few Doctors are bad doctors, and when a clinic is shut down nothing is done to help the patients whom were seeing this doctor. They are left to suffer or kill themselves. Please stop this, stop these laws that are hurting only pain patients.

"222","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am under 65 years of age and I am a Medicare patient. I've been diagnosed for over 20 years with degenerative disc disease, bulging and herniated discs, spinal stenosis, failed lumbar and cervical fusions, neuropathy, radiculopathy, spinal tumors and other illnesses.

I've tried other medications first before opioids including, tramadol, ibuprofen, vioxx, naproxen, voltaren gel and lidoderm patches. I've also tried physical therapy, aqua therapy, chiropractor, acupuncture,TENs and  numerous epidural steroid injections, facet injections and rhizotomys.They were unable to control my pain. I take gabapentin also. I take it as directed  and do not mix with alcohol.

If Medicare refuses to pay and if I'm unable to get my prescription medications over 90MME, my life will forever change. I will not be able to do most of what I do now including taking care of my home and my family.
I've been a compliant patient. I've signed a contract with my pain management Dr. I have random urinalysis and blood work. I have to have all my prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. My condition will not improve. It will only get worse with age.

The CDC guidelines were written by non pain management Physicians. These guidelines are scaring pain management Dr's. Some are tapering or cutting their patients completely off of their opioid medications causing withdrawal and uncontrollable pain, some leading to suicide. This will more than likely also increase the number of people requesting disability as they will no longer be able to work.My medical care should be between myself and my physician ONLY! We all do not respond to medication the same way. 
If you were to limit me to a 7 day supply while seeking an exemption over 90MME it would cause undue stress onto myself, my Doctor and my pharmacy.

"225","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a pain patient who has lived with severe rheumatoid arthritis and its resulting damage for 30 years and my husband is a pain patient resulting from an injury decades ago. 

By definition, patients who receive Medicare and/or Medicaid are the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and the poorest of our society. Trying to find doctors, let alone specialists, to treat patients who receive Medicare or Medicaid is already difficult due to miserly reimbursements and overly burdensome rules and processes required of physicians who participate in these programs

Physicians are already under a number of restrictions to ensure oversight for treatment of chronic pain patients, and many have already chosen to stop treating pain patients, making the task of finding a qualified pain specialist even more difficult. Making it even more burdensome to treat those patients with medical need for higher doses of opioids would hurt chronic pain patients.

Furthermore, the 90 MME/day limit proposed is arbitrary and is not backed by scientific evidence. Even the concept of the morphine equivalent doses (MME) is widely disputed within the medical community.

Patients may have metabolisms that process medications rapidly, requiring more medications; at least 10-20 percent of chronic pain patients are believed to have such metabolic conditions. (Ironically, it is difficult to impossible to get such genetic testing covered under Medicare/Medicaid.) Furthermore, many patients have other problems with digestion, absorption, and even basic efficacy. Simply put, patients are not all alike and each patient deserves treatment that appropriately considers their unique physiology. Politicians and bureaucrats should not be making medical treatment decisions; that should be the role of licensed physicians treating their patients personally. Patients who require more than 90 MME/day dosing are not new pain patients who are opioid-nave. Physicians typically start with the lowest doses possible and only increase doses when sufficient relief is not obtained.

This proposal would also discourage prescribing of benzodiazepenes in combination with opioids. Many pain patients have multiple types of pain. Muscle relaxers, anti-seizure medication, and anti-spasmodic medications all treat various types of nerve disorders which occur as co-morbid conditions in many patients who require opioid pain relief for other sources of their pain.  Pain patients also frequently battle severe anxiety requiring medication. This measure would mean that physicians would have to choose which conditions to treat, leaving other conditions effectively untreated if they are unable to prescribe appropriate combinations of medications.

As for proposals to limit prescriptions for acute pain to seven days, or as few as 3 days, the generalization of acute pain is far too broad to account for the variety of types and severities of acute pain that require medication. Those patients with the most severe pain requiring longer doses would have great difficulty to make extra doctor and pharmacy visits in such a short time frame. For example, my knee replacement surgeries required pain medications for several months while undergoing painful rehabilitative exercise. Some other surgeries I've had required very little pain medication. Some patients are healthier than others when an acute injury occurs. And some injuries are far worse than others. This measure is based on a dangerous overgeneralization of all acute pain being equal, and amounts to practicing medicine by regulation.

Imagine living in severe pain, every day, morning to night. Imagine that you have gone to many, many doctors for many years in vain, hoping for surgery or a treatment that would actually fix the underlying condition and thus stop the pain. Imagine having tried every alternative therapy available, such as trigger point injections, epidural injections, radiofrequency ablation, physical therapy, EMDR, meditation, acupuncture, even medical marijuana, with limited success and diminishing returns. (Ironically, many alternative treatments aren't even covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid, further limiting pain patients' options.)

Now imagine that the only relief you have been able to get is from opioids, and that you are one of the unlucky ones who requires doses exceeding 90 MME/day. Imagine that despite having been a compliant patient taking medication as directed, medically stable, and without a substance abuse issue, that you are now unable to get enough medication to be effective in relieving the pain. 

The Geneva Convention prohibits torture of prisoners of war. It is considered inhumane to leave a wounded pet suffering in pain without relief. 

Pain patients deserve better treatment than pets and prisoners of war. They have committed no crime. Don't punish pain.

"226","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Greetings,
		I retired at age 59 due to the disability I have. I am a licensed psychologist, Emeritus, and taught courses relating to drugs at the college and university level in addition to maintaining a private practice for over 30 years.  I am not naive about opioids.  My father used opioids for many years to help control pain associated with FSHD.  Seeing first hand how that helped him was my first direct exposure to these drugs.  

		I am a Medicare patient and was diagnosed with FSHD in 1977.  When I was about 45 years old the pain I experienced associated with FSHD really started to impact my home life and work so I began using n-saids, which I developed strong GI problems with. During that time I was also prescribed Bupropion. Additionally I have tried physical therapy, therapeutic massage, Rolfing, CBT/mindfulness, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, biofeedback, medical cannabis, creams and natural remedies, but they all failed to adequately control my pain, so I still require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and allow me to live my life. Opioids improve my ability to function during work and chores, with family, travel, and all activities of daily living.  This disease I have is chronic and progressive.  It won't go away and will continue to get worse.  If Medicare and private insurers refuse to pay and if I do not have access to opioid medication over 90 MME, I will most certainly be confined and unable to function. My income, has already been compromised, as my co-pays have risen to over $100/month in addition to about $360/month I pay for part D.  My home, transportation and family have already been affected.

		I have a pain contract which has been in place since I started using opioids.  I am subjected to random UAs.  I keep my meds locked and have a written record of every pill I have taken since I began using opioids.  I do this so I know when and what I have taken each day.  My condition will probably not improve and the effects of time and aging will likely make things worse for me. Opioids were a last resort for me.  I was not happy about starting on them.  My opioid dosage has not been increased since it was stabilized 8 years ago.  The dose was decreased last December by my doctor as a result of the pressures she feels from the CDC. That has not been good for me.  I have more pain which affects not only me, but all those around me.  
		The CDC should be embarrassed.  Their proposed policies are not supported by any proven studies. Everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently.  CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.  What is up with that?

		These policies will, I believe, create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.  In fact, all of these things are already happening.

		Forcing involuntary tapers and withdrawals increase the risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke, and cardiac issues. 
	      I am disabled, 66 years old and pain medication helps me prevent falls by stabilizing my pain.  Even with it and the use of canes or walking poles I still fall frequently.
		My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.  I take opioids safely - I do not use alcohol or other substances and use opioids as directed.

		A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when I am in pain.  A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship that won't take into account injury, size, individual metabolizing rates, genetics or other factors.
		Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

As a long time , legacy chronic pain patient I am concerned at these increasing actions taken to limit, reduce, and restrict access of necessary medicines to patients who have pain. 
While I am not against the monitoring of patients, and making sure that prescriptions for these medicines and the medicines themselves don't fall into the wrong hands...namely people who don't need them, and people who want to sell them, I am against measures taken that 1) simply place more burdens, restrictions, inconvenience, stigma, paperwork, delays, and stress to patients who need them when they are the frail, elderly, disabled, poor, and in severe pain and should have easier access and assures access to these much needed medicines, and 2) these measure do nothing about the rise in addiction, the rise of overdoses, the rise in heroin use, the rise of use of illicit fentanyl analogues, and don't stop anyone from using and abusing drugs. We have proof that it is actually rising.
The real culprit in the opioid crisis is ILLEGAL drugs, NOT prescribed pain medicines used by patients.
Yet ALL the restrictions, and measures lie SOLELY on the backs and wallets of the most innocent of these...the pain patients.
I have several chronic pain issues. I have tried EVERYTHING. Including surgery. 
I did not just out of the blue at the first hint of discomfort demand tons of pills and gobble up massive amounts of pills.
I have always observed all the rules, regulations, dosing guidelines, and never had any issues. No side effects, and no adverse events. My issues are INCURABLE. I have been suffering with constant, nagging, agonizing, daily persistent pain now for the LAST 10 YEARS.
The ONLY thing that I have taken that has helped significantly to manage my pain has been the prescription opioid pain relievers. I don't drink alcohol, mix drugs, or misuse or abuse my medicines, and certainly do NOT sell them.
I have been treated as an addict for these last 10 years. A sort of gas lighting, Munchausen by Proxy dynamic has arisen, and even though I am innocent, I am still treated with suspicion and as a criminal, or criminal about to do something.
I would like to know, considering there are SO few options for pain patients to manage their pain, HOW it is possible for anyone to want to further restrict and reduce these much needed and life saving medicines? and withhold them from patients who need them?
It seems we put in all these safeguards to prevent 1) addicts from getting these medicines, and 2) drug dealers from getting these medicines, so we try not to prescribe to these people...so that when the real pain patient arrives, THEY will have access to their much needed medicines. But not so anymore...now the pain patient arrives and now we don't prescribe to them either!  Doctors will not prescribe. Pharmacies will always be out of stock nowadays, refuse to fill them , and insurance companies place arbitrary limits, and drown us in unneccessary and punitive levels of paperwork.

These POS hard edits are inhumane, draconian and not medically substantiated measures. It is not the place for anyone but the doctor to start or stop medicines. These measures will only severely hinder the poor, who may not have transportation, copay money the elderly who are already struggling to keep up, may not have transportation, and the disabled, also who are likely to be poor, not mobile, not have transportation either, can't afford more visits and copays, and can't spend all this time back and forth trying to satisfy these paperwork demands. 
It will all INCREASE the already freezing chilling effect on those that prescribe these medicines.!
It is actually a law that ..""A public entity shall not discriminate on the basis of illegal use of drugs against an individual who is not engaging in current illegal use of drugs ""...

Department of Justice 
35.131   Illegal use of drugs. 
(a) General. 
(1)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  section,  this  part  does     not     prohibit     discrimination     
against an individual based on that individual's current illegal use of drugs. 
(2) A public entity shall not discriminate on the basis of illegal use of drugs against an individual who is not engag-
ing  in  current  illegal  use  of  drugs  and  
who (i)  Has  successfully  completed  a  supervised  drug  rehabilitation  program  or   has   otherwise   been   rehabilitated   successfully; 
(ii)  Is  participating  in  a  supervised  
rehabilitation program; or 
(iii) Is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use. 
Please do not place the burden on the already disabled, poor, and elderly backs of pain patients.
Prescription opioid abuse among pain patients is recorded at the most only 5%. Literally 95% of pain patients do not abuse their meds!

"243","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA," I have a connective tissue disorder, called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. It's a cousin disorder to something more common that you may have heard of, Marfan's Syndrome. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome however, is rarely diagnosed correctly, and still is categorized as a rare illness. The gist of this syndrome, is that my body cannot produce enough collagen.Collagen makes up a large portion of your body, including skin, hair, organ linings, arteries and veins, and the cushioning between joints. That means, my skin is very fragile and bruises easily. I am at higher chance for organ perforation and rupture, as well as prolapses. It also puts me at risk of death from spontaneous aneurysm. The most painful of all, is that it makes my joints extremely hypermobile, meaning my joints dislocate very easily. Easily enough, that I wake up from sleeping with dislocations, that I have to reduce myself before I can even get out of bed.

Ehlers Danlos isn't the only painful disease I have, I also have: Chiari Malformation, Endometriosis, Craniocervical Instability, Dysautonomia, and Mast Cell Activation disorder. Which cause anything from migraines, heavy painful periods, and tachycardia, to severe gnawing bone pain and random anaphylaxis. Several of my diseases have been described by experts, to be just as bad as cancer pain, and they also put me at a higher risk for developing things like cancer, MS, and parkinson's. I didn't ask for any of these diseases. They are things that I was genetically born with. I didn't ask to be in excruciating pain every minute of every day. So why are you trying to punish me and people like me? 

The current climate in this country surrounding opioids and pain management in general  is atrocious. 


To fix an addiction problem, which ultimately stems from mental illness; the solution provided by  the current administration and PROP  is to take pain management away from everyone? Including chronically ill and disabled individuals? It doesn't make sense to me, and in fact, I see it causing an even bigger issue. Every day, I'm hearing of multiple suicides committed by chronic pain patients, because they have been grossly neglected by the medical system to the point where they cannot take the pain anymore. Not to mention, not treating pain is not an option. It just isn't. Not treating pain can cause spontaneous death, heart attack, stroke, and other life threatening events. A pain patient receiving opioid medication, is no different than a diabetic receiving insulin. The only difference is diabetic medications don't have street value. Just because a pain patient's medications do, doesn't mean they should be denied medical treatment. Especially when the addiction rate among chronic pain patients is under 4%.

People need these medications to function. Have you ever had the flu? No I'm not talking about a cold, but the flu. Body aches,dislocations,  bone pain, fevers, severe stomach cramps, organs twisting and eating themselves, extreme exhaustion, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, etc etc. and it stuck around for days on end? Well now imagine it never going away. Imagine having to stand up, imagine having to function, take care of your house, go to work, prepare food, care for your children? People cannot function in that amount of pain, day after day; and frankly to insinuate that someone should have to, is grossly inhumane. Frankly, if this deliberate behavior by PROP and other elected officials continues, in some cases it could be looked at like a eugenics movement to erradicate disabled individuals.

To fix this problem, knowledgable doctors and actual chronic pain patients NEED to be included in this discussion on how to fix the 'Opioid Crisis', as it is affecting us more than anyone else. Taking medication away from us won't keep illicit drugs off the street if they are coming over the borders. Andrew Kolodny, who is  a part of the opioid commision, is historically anti-opioid, and has manipulated numbers in order to push his own agenda. An agenda that created the 2016 opioid guidelines, which have been widely misinterpreted to be mandates, rather than guidelines; and in turn is causing medical neglect, suicides and sudden deaths of thousands of american citizens.

Please stop and consider that there are real people who are being affected by these laws. People who didn't ask to be disabled or in intractable pain all the time. You cannot take EVERY form of pain management away from them, or you will have another epidemic on your hands. Every day people are taking their lives because of doctors neglecting their duties because of the pressure that the government is putting on them. Not treating pain is NOT an option. Unless you want another epidemic on your hands; one that these laws will have started and will be responsible for. Please include chronic pain patients in this discussion and STOP deleting their comments because they don't fit your agenda; as that is ILLEGAL.

"247","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been forced to a much lower dosage by the VA which until 2016 was very caring in the amount of pain I was and will be in for the rest of my life.
Having served in the Military for 29 yrs (21 1/2 yrs active) I was injured several times in Vietnam and even while on active duty years later occasionally I suffered cervical pain which forced my head to lock up on my left shoulder. I was given Valium  along with moist heat packs until the lock up was gone (3 times on active duty for about 10 days). I also had three right knee operations, the first one failed due to the ligaments not being attached properly and the last two left me with no miniscus in my right leg and my left knee developed osteoarthritis and a Baker's Cyst but was not operated on.
During the surgeries I was given hydrocodone and when the procedure was complete I was returned to active duty with no issues with dependence or addiction.
In 1996 I had my cervical disc's fused (C5-6) which stopped the locking up issue with my head to shoulder, but after retiring I was involved in a car crash that killed my Daughter and further injured me to the point where I finally had to see the VA for help. My Daughter was brought back to life but suffered major fractures, TBI, and eventually was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.
The VA was very helpful from 1998 to 2016 since I was a single father bringing up 2 children on my own. I had no issue with contracts and never abused the medications given to me. I was on a much larger dosage than I am now, and to lower it to what you wish to do will probably end up leaving me in more pain than I already am, and I don't understand why you would want to interfere with what little I take today.
I was refused needed cervical surgery by a Neurosurgeon who said ""The amount of pain killers I would need post op would kill me."" yet the same Doctor told me to come see him when I was ""drug free"". Having worked in the Military as a Special Forces Medic this made no sense at all to me. and as a result my left main brachial nerve is dying, leaving me in sharp pain and losing the use of my left arm. 
I served my Country in war and in peace and people who are acting out of a sense of hysteria have put my well being and that of many other people to risk of death since I cannot move as I once used to.
That I should be marked as an addict is an affront to the Service that I gave to my Country. I and many others who suffer acute pain daily do not look for a way to get ""high"" but I find it hard to sleep through the night since sharp cervical and spinal pain wakes me up on average five times a night.
To drop us to  90 mg. daily would result in me being more confined than I already am and given over to a slow and agonizing death. 
This does nothing to address the failure of cartynal laced heroin from killing street addicts and young people looking to ""escape reality"" while all I want to do is to continue to  study a foreign language and study Scripture which is part of my faith.
In my 68 years of  life, I've never seen things so out of control and authorities are blaming the group who needs the most help and protection from the CDC. Please do not condemn us for wanting to live.

In fact, as far as we know there are NO ceiling limits in regard to appropriate dosing of opiate medications in the appropriate clinical setting.

This would be an absolute travesty given my comments.  At a bare minimum, we should be impelled to further our research for the use of opiates in any pain setting.

Doctors refusing to write for opioids that they had been giving patients for years without other options available and for those dependent sending them into withdrawal (dependence very very different from addiction) does nothing to address the opioid problem.

.  
Preventing Medicare members from getting appropriate pain relief medications will force them to use more emergent care facilities and or more frequent visits to their own providers to gain access to the pain relief.  
Although it is agreed that SOME Medicare members are addicted to opioids and SOME may have started their addiction from prescribed opioids thru their medical providers for needed services the reality is this group of citizens is not the focus group for drug addiction and this regulation is counterproductive
.
The only thing that this is going to do is drive the members, in real need, to seek opioids in either nefarious ways or force some to pay out of pocket or remain in pain or as I suggested seek care in ""Ready-care"" type facilities or even actual EDs when the pain can no longer be tolerated
Tying our hands as clinicians is the wrong approach.  

We need access to drugs that can be EASILY accessed to help these as well as all patients.  We are fine with limiting the initial numbers of pain medications for post-surgical or post event-related situations BUT we then need to have drugs approved thru the DEA for us to easily aid the patients when the small amount of initial opioids has been insufficient and they truly do need more

We used to have this in the form of Vicodin (hydrocodone) but when it was moved from Schedule 3 to 2 we lost the ability to call in the drug for either after hours or weekend or other such need.  Now the ONLY way to assist a patient in pain is to physically see them which costs them more and doesn't stop the prescription of the drug.  Surely this bill isn't trying to totally prevent a patient in pain from getting their drug so what is the intent once the small number is exceeded and more is in need?  Surely the answer is not ""let them suffer""

We need a comprehensive solution NOT a knee-jerk penalty based response that shifts the blame rather than helping the needy and monitoring the otherwise potential addict.

A. greater than 10 years of treatment 
B. are greater than 50 years of age(for most but allow for some exceptions) 
C. have followed the rules by using the same Doctor or practice for that same period of time:

BE EXEMPT from this ruling.

Many have followed the rules for years  and even when they have suffered due to ""breakthrough events"" they still stayed within their prescribed regimen.  No one should have to withdraw to an ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS number. YES, 90 MME is a "" dartboard number regardless of the so called ""data"" to support it. Real lives and real people that are working and in some way still trying to contribute to society will be permanently damaged by this ""RULE""

The deaths of the famous such as Prince and Tom Petty show not that they overdosed because negligence.They were forced to get their ""unknown strength"" medications through nefarious means. Had they been able to obtain the EXACT dose that met their tolerance levels they would still be alive today.

HOWEVER YOUR SO CALLED RULES, which are no more than ""color of law"" are in some part RESPONSIBLE for theirs and many many other deaths that are not even being properly counted  Numbers like 64,000 a years are not even backed up with correct scientific data gathering processes!

The ""toothpaste"" cap was taken off around 1989 and now you want to put the lid back on. And your ""color of law , rules"" are KILLING people i like and people you know because after YEARS of STABLE prescribed doses YOUR ""GROUP"" wants to ""downgrade their lives""  through no fault of their own.

That alone VIOLATES that CITIZENS right to LIFE  LIBERTY AND PURSUIT of (their happiness)

A few more issues:

REMS  intro in 2009-2010  at UMPC in Pittsburgh PA and across the country began to ween the ""low hanging fruit"". Those who had no business on opiates. Then the pharmacy burglaries started. 

Then the total number of opioid prescriptions began to decline in 2011. The ""self-policing"" by medical institutions had begun to work.

Then in 2013 with Edward Snowden and the TOR browser and the dark web was suddenly famous and since nature abhors a vacuum the CHINESE MADE AND INDIAN AND PAKISTANI made FENTANYL  began to hit the market.

So those with the proclivity to abuse just found their Valhalla. 

Then enter in the STORM TROOPER TACTICS at doctors offices across the country and many that :

:Would NEVER OVERDOSE BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING IN THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS were being kicked to the street. Doctors who gave up 1/3 of their lives to get their license to practice were not going to jeopardize that. And they should NEVER have been but into that position by some 27 year old cop with 3 months training!

Look there are many good people with stable lives that SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE ""NEW"" RULES. The long term STABLE patients that have done what they are supposed to should not have their lives and livelihood TAKEN from them by the bureaucrat!

And for those since this MAXIMUM pressure began in earnest in 2015 that were stable patients should be allowed to goto whatever  their stable dose was while being carefully titrated on a case by case basis.  But again  only for those with a long history and full documentation. That way we are being fair to those that are hanging on by a thread with inadequate relief.  And Doctor's like Dr. Forest Tenant should have their practices restored and compensation paid.

Those that have committed suicide because of these rules will never be compensated however for the ""exisiting"" we can allow them to live again and we should.

The one thing you can't seem to show us is someone who is five years stable on an opiate, a benzo and gabapentin type drug. You NEVER tell those which are many because it would shoot holes  in your whole ""movement"" Properly used in combination with patient education, citizens have a great quality of life. 

Many citizens who has benefited from opiate therapy and I see many who have. I have observed some who should never have been and they were washed out at the Doctor level long before  ""new rules"" were even being talked about.

The opioid crises is a LIE  We have a illegal HEROIN and FENTANYL supplied CHINESE< INDIAN  PAKISTANI and other sources PROBLEM. THAT is where the DEA and FBI should be looking not in a US Doctors office!

Remember LONG TERM STABLE citizens that have benefited and followed the rules should NOT BE TAKEN OFF or reduced.

"262","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Millions of chronic pain patients, already living in agony because of disease or injuries, now live in fear that their medicine will be taken away because they've been stigmatized as drug addicts.

Ninety percent of those who die of overdoses use illicit drugs.

Why is this still invisible to policy-makers? I don't understand how any reasonably intelligent person could look at the CDC's overdose numbers and not notice that overdoses are driven by illicit fentanyl, not prescription medication.  

Pain doctors says that, when it comes to opioids, there is a big difference between addiction and dependence.

News reports about the so-called opioid epidemic routinely claim that opioids kill more than 60,000 Americans per year, but it's not prescription drugs.

Opioid prescriptions have dropped every year since 2011 by nearly 50 percent, but opioid deaths have gone up during the same period.

One reason is because addicts who previously, one way or another, obtained prescription meds are now taking street drugs, if someone had a plan to drive Americans to try heroin, it worked.

""When we talk about opioids, do we mean prescription or illicit such as heroin? Heroin cannot be prescribed in the U.S., but it is being conflated with all the other opioids. It creates hysteria and alarm.

This confounding and conflation of illicit opioids with prescription pain medication is being used to hide the fact that pain patients aren't causing or even contributing to this ""overdose crisis"".  

Illicit fentanyl, smuggled in from China and other places, is 100 times more powerful than heroin and it is the single deadliest opioid of all  a 540 percent increase in overdoses in one year.

Policy makers mistakenly lump together all opioid deaths, whether legal or illicit, and in order to ""do something"" about it, they have gone after the only non-moving target  chronic pain patients, who are paying a terrible price because of irresponsible actions by addicts.

""To arbitrarily deny prescription pain medicine to those folks who need it, to reduce dosage without regard for their individual function, is problematic.""

Any medical ""care"" done without regard for the individual is problematic. Withholding pain relief is more than problematic, it's shameful, mean, and immoral.

""When people are experiencing pain, if they cannot get relief through their prescriber, what do you think is going to happen?"" Ziegler said.

For millions of chronic pain patients, opioids are the only thing that works.

It's nice to see this truth stated so plainly. This simple fact usually goes unmentioned (unknown or hidden?) by most of the media.

""We have patients that we've been seeing for 25 years that are on stable doses of medication who have not overdosed,"" said Dr. Marx.

But in the eyes of politicians and some regulators, opioid users are addicts who must forcibly be taken off drugs.

On what evidence do they base their assertion that pain patients must be forcibly ""taken off drugs""?

There is absolutely no evidence to support these actions, policies, and laws seeking to restrict medical pain relief.

Dr. Marx says pain patients are certainly dependent on their medications, the same way a diabetic needs insulin, but that dependence is not addiction.

Dr. Marx says pain patients do develop a dependence on their medication, but they can take it basically forever without harm. 

It allows them to keep their jobs, remain active, have a life.

Those who've had their meds cut have suffered terribly, and many have committed suicide. Their need for medication is not addiction.

""Dependence is not addiction,"" Ziegler said. ""Withdrawal is not addiction. Addiction is a completely separate matter.

A lot of people can be managed well on prescription therapy. For those who can be managed well, why are you trying to change their treatment?""","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-1037","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Michael Ayers-CA"

The proposed changes to Part D regarding opioid prescribing is not only discriminatory on the chronically ill, chronic pain patients and the disabled community due to its undue burdens placed upon them to receive adequate access to the medically necessary pain management medications including opioid analgesics and Gabapentin. These individuals often lack the financial ability to pay for their doctors appointments therefore it is unreasonable both financially to expect individuals suffering from painful illnesses and/or conditions to be able to go to the doctor once a week. Further our physician offices and hospitals do not have the capacity to take on such a large increase in patient load. In addition, the hard and soft edits intended for Medicare and Medicaid recipients are based on policy and not patient-centered; evidence-based medical care that ensures the best approach to treatment is provided to each patient on an individualized basis which can only be determined by our qualified medical doctors. In addition, there is no scientific study nor clinical trial substantiating the CDC Guidelines of 90 Milligram Morphine Equivalents as recommended and being taken up as policy at CMS for FY19. The aging of our population, increased chronic illness, disease and disabilities within the community are all factors into why it is vital our doctors maintain their ability to prescribe as they see appropriate for their patients. The outlined proposal for 2019 is an unworkable plan with undue burdens placed on the disabled, the physicians, regulatory boards and hospitals and further it insights discrimination in our medical care against those among us whom are the weakest. In addition, as a chronic illness patient suffering a debilitating medical condition I find it abhorrent that such policies would be considered given the clear obstacles for any individuals suffering from an illness or painful condition to be able to adhere to so many appointments both financially and physically. In addition, it exposes many ill patients to environmental factors that could be further detrimental to their health and well being. Finally, I advised you to kindly refer to FDA Docket # FDA-2017-P-5396-0001 in which a Citizens Petition is requesting to remove high dose opioid analgesics from the market and is currently under review due to extension review being required. Given this I feel we need to also put this measure on hold and allow for further public comment and impact studies on current measures taken to combat the opioid epidemic before implementing hard line policies that will impact the sickest, poorest American citizens. We must protect the chronic illness, chronic pain and disabled community while we work to protect those suffering from substance use disorder Finally, please find enclosed 128 letters our Organization, Chronic Illness Advocacy & Awareness Group, collected on behalf of our members, my personal letter and my mother's letter for your consideration when making such decision. These are the stories of real individuals these decisions will directly impact through these proposed changes for 2019. We urge you to remove these undue burdens on medication access to ensure the safety of the American public.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0957","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Gayle Onnen-MO"

"271","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Though these expectations were first set out in the CY 2013 Call Letter and supplemental guidance, the CY 2019 notice proposes new strategies to manage chronic overuse. These strategies include:
1.	Adding additional flags to the Overutilization Management System (OMS) for beneficiaries who use drugs that increase the effects of a substance (potentiators).
2.	Revising PQA opioid quality measures used by CMS and adding a new measure for the concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazapines.
3.	Implementing hard edits at the point-of-sale at the pharmacy at a specific dosage level and with a 7 day supply, as well as soft edits based on duplicative therapy that can be overridden by the pharmacist.
4.	Implementing a days' supply limit for initial fills of prescription opioid for treating acute pain or without a daily dose maximum. CMS provides details on how they expect plan sponsors to implement each of these strategies and seeks comments on these proposals. Comments on both the Advance Notice and Call Letter and the Advance Notice of Methodological Changes are due March 5th.
It is important to note that the use of these classes of medications for chronic conditions should not be conflated with chronic overuse. As constructed, these changes neither address nor differentiate between these concerns.  Of concern -
1.	The potentiators between drug classes should be determined and communicated with patient counseling about individual needs and characteristics of drugs and their prescribing based on patient genetic and phenotypic characteristics.
2.	The risk benefit assessment for concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines should be clearly spelled out and not left to chance communications.
3.	Hard edits at point of sale are unreasonable and unaffordable for the majority of users.  This assumes access to physicians, lack of geographic and insurance barriers.  It will add unnecessary cost to some households where resources are slim. This is a matter for physician discretion after evaluation of needs and resources.
4.	Hard edits at physician or pharmacy level for acute pain are unreasonable, deny the nature of the injury or illness, and are unaffordable for the majority of users.  This assumes access to physicians, lack of geographic and insurance barriers.  It will add unnecessary cost to some households where resources are slim. This is a matter for physician discretion after evaluation of needs and resources.
I support increased disability utilization review processes, but hard edits are not the same as reviewing the needs of individual patients coupled with their resources. Furthermore, capitation imposes real risks to patients regarding the management of Part C and Part D contracts. Plan holders accept patient fees and sell them a catalog of providers with no assurance that their needs will be met.  This very real problem impairs the very access needed to service these changes as proposed. It will increase administrative cost, reduce patient satisfaction, and has great potential to actually result in harm to patients who cannot get access to physicians on the 8th day of Rx renewal.  To allege that this will create and encourage chaos is an understatement as the physician stable of providers is simply unavailable to support throughput as this is constructed. I am opposed to these changes.  Every bit of this can be taken care of through physician patient communications.

I am a Medicare patient.

I am a pain patient diagnosed with Failed Back Surgery, Spinal Stenosis, Bulging Disks, Degenerative Disk & Joint Disease, Fibromyalgia, Spondyloarthrapathy, osteoarthritis as well as many GI problems as well for almost 20 years, formally diagnosed for 12 years. I tried everything available both OTC and prescription, including epidural injections,nerve ablation, physical therapy and aquatherapy, TENS unit and surgery but they all failed to help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications along with Gabapentin.

Opioids and Gabapentin help me by managing my pain and at least allow me a small part of my life with my family. I was immobile before starting opiate therapy. I have lost my ability to work, losing a 20 year career, but instead of spending 24 hours a day in bed, I'm able to visit family for short periods of time, eat dinner with the family instead of in bed occassionally and beginning to gain some self esteem again.

If Medicare refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication I will again lose my mobility, family relationships, self-confidence, and the ability to fight!

My pain has been managed by the same neurosurgeon for over 12 years now. I have never abused or misused my medications. For 7 of those years I received my opiods through an intrathecal pain pump, but in january 2018 I had to have the pump removed due to some extreme GI issues requiring extensive upcoming surgery.

My condition is not only permanent, but progressing. My latest appointment with my Rheumatologist and upcoming tests will confirm that I have now progressed from spondyarthropathy to Ankylosing Spondylitis.

Over the last 12 years I have used two pharmacies. The first one for about 9 years and my current one for about 3.

Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.

These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.

Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.

I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.

My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.

A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.

A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.

I take my Medications safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed. I Keep them away safely and have never Shared them with anyone!

Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

When I had my pump removed, I had to go through dependancy withdrawls, not addiction withdrawls. My body NEEDS my Medication to function. Without them I will lay in bed writhing in pain waiting to die. I WANT To LIVE! Please help me keep the little quality of life of worked so hard to get!

Rather than pencil pushers and number crunchers drafting items like this faster than anyone can realize the effects,
 go into the nursing homes, find people who are 65 and up and listen to them.  
Go into the RV parks and listen to the elderly who have had to sell their homes because they have reached Medicare and Socia
 Security age and the programs are not turning out to be what they were initially designed for.
Stop taking benefits away from those who have worked and paid their dues
Take polls from people who are actually on medicare and medicaid, most of them are completely unaware of what is being done
  and how it affects them  
Go into the forums such as the mayo clinic or any other forum related to chronic pain or those with disabilities - you people are not 
listening and are oblivious to what is happening 
You don't have to be articulate or follow the commenters checklist provided above to have and express an opinion about something
  that is wrong.  This is wrong.
 - you can't tell someone's chronic pain to stop because their is a $cap so you'll have to wait
-you can't force someone to take the generic version of a medicine because it is cheaper, it doesn't work like that.  Have you ever
  heard of genetic testing for medicines pharmacogenics, not everyone has the same reaction to medicine.  For example, my husband
  takes lyrica, Jan 1st due to medicare and insurance changes he could no longer receive lyrica unless he wanted to spend $1000 per month
out of pocket he was forced to use gabapentin until we could find and pay for yet another supplemental insurance that would cover 
 lyrica for him.  Don't speak to me of an ""override nor tell me generic is the same as name brand  because it is NOT if it were the cost would be
the same and there really wouldn't be a need for generic medication.  It's like going to the grocery store and buying cereal, do you want the name
brand cereal in the box or the bag version for $2 less.  Ask your children they will want the namebrand because it's better.  Same principle with medication.  
-stop messing with Medicare and Medicaid unless your going to increase benefits and payments to those who desperately need it
 and have paid for it.
-here is a thought focus your pencil pushing, number crunching ideas towards getting people off welfare who haven't worked a full year 
 since they turned 18 and are drawing a check and have medicaid
-focus on those who are in line at walmart with vouchers to pay children they keep having when they can't afford it 
-STOP messing with the elderly people who at 65 have numerous health problems and need help 
-SHAME on you, attached are some of the conversations going on about elderly, chronic pain, opiod crisis crap, CARA bill what a joke.
-People who are going to abuse will do just that, if they were law abiding citizens they would not be abusing drugs or the system
to begin with.  You can pass all the bills and put all the rules in place you want to but it is not helping the people who truly need
help.

Established in 2003, Commonwealth Care Alliance (CCA) is a community-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization dedicated to improving care for people with complex chronic conditions, including multiple disabilities. For individuals who are dually eligible for MassHealth, the Medicaid program in Massachusetts, and Medicare, our unique, nationally recognized health plans provide and coordinate the full spectrum of care - medical, behavioral health, dental, durable medical equipment and social services - to eliminate gaps in care and reduce costs. Disability-competent direct primary care is provided by our wholly owned clinical affiliate, Commonwealth Community Care, an organization with more than 30 years of experience supporting adults with complex physical, developmental, intellectual and mental health disabilities, as well as through over 27,000 providers in our contracted provider network.

CCA serves more than 25,000 beneficiaries statewide in Massachusetts through our dual eligible special needs plan (D-SNP) and our Medicare-Medicaid Financial Alignment Initiative plan.  Our D-SNP plan provides services to over 9,000 beneficiaries, the vast majority of whom are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid age 65 and above.  We have consistently achieved four stars or above in the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings program, including achieving five stars on 18 measures and four stars on another 12 measures for 2018.

CCA supports a number of provisions in this proposed rule that would promote greater alignment of medical and non-medical coverage and encourage enrollment in aligned plans.  We believe these proposed changes will help special needs plans and MMPs achieve better coordination of medical and non-medical services and supports.

"286","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am writing on behalf of many chronic pain patients who are also Medicare patients. 

If Medicare refused to pay for their opioid medication that goes over the ""recommended MMEs"" per day, they would be in a true bind. Opioids do not only keep patients functional; they keep them alive. 

I have a loved one who has been on a stable dose of opioid medicine for many years, regularly drug tested, etc. They have NEVER smoked, drank (not even wine or beer) or done any type of recreational drugs whatsoever. 

They tried every available option there was for pain relief, before having to resort to opioid medication. These included over-the-counter medicines, prescription strength Ibuprofen, Tramadol, Neurontin (3 different times, at high doses), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and much more, including 3 different types of nerve blocks, cold laser therapy, TENS unit, prolotherapy, physical therapy, acupuncture and psychiatric counseling. 

They resisted going to pain management and having to resort to opioid medicines until the pain was so out of control that it was threatening their very life. 

I and my loved one understand very well the need to do all that is possible to curb the opioid epidemic, but doubling down on chronic pain patients is NOT the way to do it. It is not the medicine prescribed for intractable pain patients that is causing this epidemic. Patients who die of overdoses almost always have some illegal drug in their systems. Patients in chronic pain do not abuse drugs; they take medicine that is necessary for life, just as a diabetic takes insulin that is necessary for their life. 

CMS's proposed policies are not supported by proven studies and the CDC guidelines were written largely a psychiatrist, NOT a pain management specialist. Some on the committee to write the CDC guidelines appear to have huge conflicts of interest and may have personally profited (and may be continuing to) from the the guidelines. 

Doctors are already overburdened and do not need extra paperwork and phone calls to make, which is what your proposals are most certainly going to cause. Either that, or worse - patients will be forced to taper medicines, risking far more than withdrawal, but risking suicide. I truly believe just ONE DAY of severe intractable pain, experienced by the people trying to ""curb the opioid epidemic"" by limiting prescriptions, would SOLVE this crisis and a U-Turn would quickly be made. 

Rural patients frequently have to travel to see a pain management specialist, since so many family doctors are no longer willing to treat pain. Requiring more visits to the doctor will create a very serious hardship for these patients. 

Prescriptions have been decreasing for over half a decade, while overdoses continue to skyrocket. Again, most of the overdoses are from people combining illegal drugs with other medicines, something that patients in chronic pain are NOT doing.

I am very concerned about the proposed CMS changes to limit opioid prescribing.
 I have practiced Family Medicine for over 40 years. I have also practiced Hospice and Palliative Medicine for over 20 years, 
a specialty that has expert knowledge in the prescribing and monitoring of opioids. 
The proposed guidelines would affect our practice of palliative care 
but more importantly would negatively impact our patients. 

1.	It would add to the patient's already existing perception of an opioid stigma 
2.	Patients might not receive adequate pain relief
3.	At the least, the patient could be delayed in the receiving proper medication
4.	Uncontrolled pain can lead to depression and desperate measures such as seeking illicitly obtained drugs 
(see Opioid Crisis)

It is hoped that CMS has the wisdom to seek the input of the Hospice and Palliative Care community in considering exemptions for the dying patient to this proposed rule.

Opioid medications along with NSAID's, and an antidepressant help to manage my pain to a bearable level. It doesn't take it completely away but, I can function. I am a mother, wife, and full time working mother who is in the industry of helping others. 

It is not right for health insurance companies to continue to make decisions for individuals they don't know. The one size fit all approach does not work. We are all different and require different treatments and medications. Our doctors go to medical school to be able to help us. They are trained and educated to provide us with appropriate treatment plans. How is it appropriate for an insurance company to supersede their decisions? Are these lawmakers physicians who have treated all of us and know our conditions? The answer is no. So, why is it appropriate for insurance companies to be involved in medication management? It's unethical and undermines these physicians choices and education. 

I understand there is a drug problem in this country;however, the main issue is illegal drugs. Not those that are used for legitimate conditions for legitimate chronic pain patients. Before making such a harsh decision regarding opioid use, meet with chronic pain patients. Sit with them. Hear their stories, and review their medical records. Stop trying to cure the drug problem in the US by hurting those who truly need it. If this continues you are likely to see increased suicide rates for those who are in too much pain. Stop thinking of us as numbers and statistics. Think of us as your mothers, brothers, sisters, and fathers. Would you hurt your own family for incorrect statistical data? Would you put your families well being in the hands of lawmakers instead of their trusted physician team? I don't think so. Please stop this madness and let these hardworking doctors do their job. They are the only ones educated and skilled to make these medication decisions.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0540","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-CA"

"294","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient diagnosed with fibromyalgia and widespread osteoarthritis. I've suffered with intractable pain for over 25 years. It was 13 years before I was prescribed an opioid. Once the right opioid and dosage was found, it was as if my life had been given back to me. I had 7 great years where I was able to raise my kids, manage a home, do volunteer work and participate in most activities as long as I paced myself. Due to current overreaching policy, I've lost access to the medication which works best for me and have also had my dose drastically reduced. While I'm still above 90 mme, I'm no longer able to participate in daily family life and activities I once enjoyed. I'm a high metabolizer and my current dosage allows my pain to be managed only if I'm at rest. I'm no longer able to, manage my home, engage in activities outside of my home and remain productive. Pacing myself is no longer an option. The sedentary lifestyle is affecting my overall health and my stamina is no longer what it used to be. It's already affecting my heart health and it's increasing my risk for stroke. 

I'm currently on Medicaid and this is in part due to the loss of access to my original medication/dosage. The loss of the correct medication and dose led to my loss of function. I'm greatly concerned that my dose could be cut again if these limits were to go into effect. My pain would not be managed and it would subject me to a bed bound state. I know I would not be alone. The lives of many chronic pain patients will be further destroyed. Therapeutic doses need to be tailored to the patient and not set by an arbitrary number. These types of restrictions are moving in the wrong direction. Doctors need to treat patients as individuals with individual needs. One size dosing does not work. If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day, this will give insurance companies and pharmacies an excuse to stop paying for my necessary prescriptions and/or dispensing them at all. Medicaid carriers are already refusing to pay for some opioids and prior authorizations are becoming harder to get approved. If a hard line dose is enforced, more patients will be forced to disability and onto Medicaid; it will create more demand for emergency room services; an increase in the rate of expensive procedures will occur...incidentally these invasive procedures are proving to not work for many and provoking further painful conditions; and tragically the rate of suicides will be increased dramatically. We are already seeing the rise of suicide numbers in veterans and others who've been subjected to live in unrelenting pain. 

We don't need more regulations. The overreach is already having severe negative consequences. The exceptions allowed by the current CDC guidelines have proved to have little to no effect on doctor prescribing. They are routinely interpreted as law. A hardline dosing limit by CMS will be no different. It will give Medicare/Medicaid insurance carriers more reason to not approve prior authorization even with exemptions of cancer, palliative care or hospice apply. No other medication has arbitrary limits imposed with no regard for the individual patient. Doctors need to be able to treat patients without these harmful arbitrary limits.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-1048","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-AZ"

Requiring an in-person appointment every 7 days is unreasonable - by definition, those are narcotics should not be driving so getting to those appointments becomes extremely problematic, especially for those in rural areas. For acute patients, they should be spending their energy recovering, not going to unnecessary doctors appointments. For chronic pain patients whose condition is stable, weekly appointments are unnecessarily time-consuming and may impact their ability to hold a job. Such frequent appointments will add yet another task for caregivers of seriously ill patients. Furthermore, this assumes the physicians will have time in their appointment schedule every week for any and all severe pain patients, something that is highly unlikely. This is unnecessarily burdensome to patients, caregivers, and doctors alike.

Allowing only the insurers the right to override that limit is begging for industry abuse - they have every incentive to deny an override and no incentive to agree. Desk workers at insurance companies (who may have very limited information regarding patients' overall medical conditions and who are not treating physicians) should NOT be responsible for determining care! They are not trained for it and they have no way to judge which patients are using medications appropriately and which ones are not since they have no face-to-face interactions with patients.

This proposed regulation treat everyone as an addict, including people recovering from serious car accidents or surgery, people with terminal cancer, and people with other significant, well-documented chronic pain issues where appropriate narcotic use allows a return to normal life. Not everyone who uses narcotics does so inappropriately and not all are addicts. There is copious evidence that appropriate narcotic use can significantly improve the quality of life for those with severe pain and that the vast majority of those appropriately prescribed narcotics do not become addicted.

Preventing appropriate and regulated medical access for those with a true need will unnecessarily disabled those with severe pain which could be treated. Furthermore, it will drive some to the street to get medication (with all its attendant dangers) and others to suicide. This overly broad regulation will destroy many more lives than it helps.

I was to return in 30 days where he would reduce by 50%.  The next 30 days by 75% less than what has been managing my pain for years.  I was told that per the CDC's new guidelines, I can't have both depression and pain medication.  I must choose one or the other and they must meet the CDC's requirements quickly.  My husband asked how would I survive on only 25% of my current pain med when it does not alleviate the pain but makes it more manageable. He said there was no choice.  Insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and the VA are demanding that doctors take a hardline approach.  I have been his patient since 2011.  I have never failed the random drug tests.  I have never had any kind of episode to cause concern.  I've self paid for every cream, vitamin, brace, tens units, ice machine, cold/hot packs, and shiatsu devices.  I've purchased almost anything pitched on infomercials to help manage the pain. I've had numerous fusions and revisions, PT, steroid injections, nerve blocks, nerve ablations.  I've tried cryotherapy, behavioral modification, and underwent a spinal stim implant trial.  The list goes on.  My condition is described as one of the worst pain conditions so I am confused as to why only cancer patients are excluded from these CDC limits. Even when in remission.  I absolutely believe they should receive everything they need but I also believe all pain conditions should have that right as well.  Why are all other pain conditions excluded?  How long will we be able to endure severe unending pain?  How long before we do something we would never consider in the past?  The CDC has essentially condemned pain patients.  How mentally stable will we remain in constant pain and now without medications for anxiety and depression?   How far will we go to seek relief?  How desperate will we become?  Some will turn to street drugs.  Some capable of working will no longer be able to work and be forced into Medicare.  Families will break.  Some will attempt suicide.  Some will commit suicide.  Will their doctors or the CDC, or both be accountable?  When creating these so called guidelines, the CDC's due diligence certainly did not include us in the category of those who are taking illegal drugs, who have not been diagnosed with conditions known to cause unbearable pain, who are drug tested regularly for compliance. So what did your data tell you?  So now that the CDC has begun to hear how the guidelines have become a mandate, and the impact it is having on pain patients, who through no fault of their own fight everyday to maintain some semblance of normalcy and quality of life, what will the CDC do now?  I am not opposed to stricter guidelines.  Chronic pain sufferers are not opposed to stricter laws.  However, you cannot treat pain as a one size fits all solution.  Pain Mgmt. Physicians should be able to provide relief, some quality of life.  Many of us have incurable conditions.  Many don't lead to death. They lead to endless suffering.  Pain Mgmt. physicians should be able to decide what their patients need and the ability  to make exceptions to these limits without repercussions from health insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and the VA.  It is clear that these guidelines require further studies.  We would welcome clinical trials of other pain management options.  Most importantly, in developing these guidelines, there must be greater transparency to patients and significant participation from the medical community that specialize in chronic pain management.  These guidelines must seek to protect and improve the lives of chronic pain patients who have already given so much.

My daughter is legally taking opioids by prescription from a pain management specialist for a pinched nerve in her back that has not been relieved by surgery. She has epilepsy. We have a letter from her neurologist stating that if she doesn't get enough sleep, she can have a seizure. These seizures can be fatal. If she is in pain because she has no opioids on board, she can't sleep. If she can't sleep, she can have a seizure. If she has a seizure, she can die. The rules are already so stringent that it's very stressful when she's afraid she won't be able to get her prescription filled in time.

You people need to make laws that will LOOSEN the restrictions on people who are legally taking opioids. That would be a service for patients. There is absolutely nothing you can do that will keep these drugs out of the hands of illegal drug users and/or sellers. If trying to do that makes it harder for patients to receive the drugs legally, you are hurting patients.

While I'm at it, I would also like to recommend that half of the people who serve on a board or committee that would be involved in making this decision, be people who are legally taking opioids. Then, at least, there would be hope that any proposed legislation would not make it harder on the patient.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0224","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-02T00:00:00-05:00","Barbara Anonymous-OR"
"307","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"            Thank you for taking comments,  I have been cut by 50% on my opiate meds, the IRs or flare up pain meds was the first one they took from me and cut my long acting meds in half it has destroyed my well being and my outlook on life. I Can NOT Stand the pain plus withdraws on top of that. Before i was prescribed these opiate meds I tried =PT,TENS,Pain Shots,Operations,Psychiatrist, and physiatrists, and all the new nsaid that now have been taking off the market or black boxed. I still suffer the stomach bleeds and heart pain if i take a couple of buffern which i have had to do again because they took my breakthrough meds away and Tough it out as 
Sessions implys.  I was taking 15 medications due to injuries an onset of illness that followed. I got so sick from the viox meds i was put in the hospital. This is when i gave in and went to the last resort opiate pain meds. From that point on i did not need all the other meds my other health problems went silent. I had pain control for the first time in Five years. I could be in the moment with my Wife and 3 Sons my Mom and Dad i was part of my Family and church again. Pain meds works for long term chronic pain and are just as safe above the 90 medd.  I am a Example of them working for 15 years with the same DR and pharmacy never failed urine or blood test or broke a contract, I take them to be present Not to exscape, Taking peoples meds that do all the right things for people that dont isnt going to fix nothing it will make things 100 times worse. If they are concern about me or people like me prescribe us narcan with our meds above 90 medd. If it had to be used you have saved some one life while letting them live a half way normal one.

                                                                                                                                                                          Thank you.

"314","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As a health care provider, I am growing increasingly more concerned about repeated attempts towards rationing many health care resources to society's most vulnerable individuals.  These changes disproportionately affect individuals without resources and access to care options that are available to younger, healthier and wealthier adults.   I would like to note that it is unethical to severely and unfairly limit the decision making process of clinicians (doctors, nurses, NPs, PAs, dentists, and other health care personnel, who make treatment decisions to support healing and to increase quality of life).  What do we hope to accomplish in opposing the basic rights of patients to receive appropriate and well established treatment, under the care of responsible and knowledgeable professionals?   
The overwhelming majority of patients who have received successful treatments for chronic pain and other debilitating illnesses have been able to achieve stable treatment goals, and are living at a good functional capacity.  In other words, they are benefiting from treatment, and are staying healthy enough to live independently.  
In order for them to continue to do so, they need to continue to receive treatment.  
They have many times worked out a plan with their doctors or other providers painstakingly, over the course of months or years, to achieve a quality of life that is safe and fulfilling.
Oftentimes, this is because they are receiving good care with appropriate medication.  
Asking a chronically ill person to make choices that will return them to their previous state of being with no treament or ineffective/possibly harmful treatments is cruel and  not sensible.  Such individuals will likely become sicker, less independent, and will then incur much higher costs to maintain a diminished quality of life.  
A chronic pain patient who cannot sleep or effectively exercise is likely to experience a downward spiral in their daily living habits, almost certainly setting them up for serious consequences down the line.  In this instance, a patient with uncontroller pain will likely experience greater social isolation as a result of pain, mental health impairments, unhealthy eating habits, limited or no exercise, eventual cardiovascular complications.  Such an individual may tend to continue a smoking habit, or seek relief though alcohol, or perhaps even feel desperate enough to turn to illegally obtained substances.  
This is a most unfortunate and avoidable trajectory, and experience has shown that inattention to the quality of a patient's day to day life will simply cause more problems of a serious nature.  
I urge you to consider the consequences of this legislation, and work to protect all individuals in obtaining the care that they need.  Thank you.

Attn: CMS-2017-0163

Dear Administrator Verma:

The Endocrine Society wishes to offer our comments on the Part D provisions of the proposed, ""Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2019 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter"". We are specifically concerned about the provision that would enable dietary supplements to be substituted for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D plans.  We urge CMS to remove references to dietary supplements in finalizing this proposal and to clarify the distinction between non-FDA regulated dietary supplements and over the counter (OTC) medications.   

Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, thyroid conditions, and hormone-related cancers. Our more than 18,000 members care for patients and are dedicated to advancing hormone research and excellence in the clinical practice of endocrinology. We promote policies to help ensure that all individuals with endocrine diseases have access to high quality, specialized care and adequate, affordable health insurance.

We are concerned that CMS's proposal would allow Part D plans ""to include additional OTC products such as dietary supplements and cough medicines, without the requirement that either product offset the use of a Part D drug."" Dietary supplements are not equivalent to, and cannot be substituted for, prescription drugs. These supplements should not be used to treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate disease and can interfere with prescribed medications. We believe that, if covered under the Part D benefit, patients may believe that they can substitute their medications and achieve comparable treatment. Physicians should advise patients on what supplements should be taken, and in what amount, to avoid negative outcomes. 

Dietary supplements are not subject to FDA approval and should not be included in the Part D Prescription Drug benefit. There is no requirement that dietary supplement manufacturers demonstrate that they are safe or effective, or even labeled appropriately before the products are marketed. Therefore, if CMS were to treat dietary supplements as substitutable for drugs, it could risk harm to patients. FDA regulations specifically prohibit dietary supplements from claiming to be a substitute for a ""product that is a therapy for a disease,"" which in conflict with CMS's proposal. We urge you to continue prohibiting dietary supplements from being substitutes to prescription drugs and to distinguish between over the counter medication and dietary supplements in the final Call Letter.  

Thank you for consideration. We would be happy to provide further information to your staff. Please contact Meredith Dyer, Director of Health Policy, at mdyer@endocrine.org if we can help.
  
Sincerely,
 
Grazia Aleppo, MD
Chair, Clinical Affairs Core Committee

"319","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Making blanket statements like 90 mg morphine equivalent are dangerous and may actually worsen the current addiction 
crisis.  An example of why this is a dangerous statement is because the drug buprenorphine, which is the only full agonist 
antagonist medication on the market is often miscalculated by insurers and BUPRENORPHINE is refused because the fact
that > 94% of MU receptors are filled when on an average of 16 mg daily.  However, there has never been an accidental 
overdose using buprenorphine.  WHY?  Because of it's pharmacology, it has a ceiling effect and despite the fact that in some 
ways some insurers classify buprenorphine as stronger than morphine equivalents, they are pushing the use of fentanyl, 
morphine, oxycontin, and even stronger drugs when we know that buprenorphine is safer than any other drug available.  A
Medicare statute that limits the use of drugs like buprenorphine would be a disaster in the treatment of chronic pain and opioid
addiction.

the other issue is the fact that chronic pain is a real phenomenon.  Disorders like Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Cancer, 
Neuropathy, CRPS or REFLEX Sympathetic Dystrophy, Chronic Angina, Peripheral Vascular Disease, Trigeminal Neuralgia
Every type of Headache you can think of, post traumatic neurologic, and musculoskeletal accidents, gunshot wounds, 
Pancreatitis, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, shingles, kidney stones, Tendonitis, bursitis, and a list of disorders a mile 
long.   Buprenorphine is a unique drug and is the only drug available that is saving lives.  WHY?  Because DATA 2000 signed 
by president Clinton in 2000 allowed for opioid addiction treatment to be offered by primary care physicians in the 
outpatient setting to treat opioid addiction.  16 mg is the average daily dose to keep craving for opiates out of the addicts
thinking process.  Yet, insurers will refuse to pay for buprenorphine because of their ability to claim that the drug is equivalent 
to morphine 90 mg.  This is not true because buprenorphine is not a full agonist but rather an opioid agonist antagonist.

The pathophysiology and pharmacology of opioid medications is very complex.  It is much like treating cancer, there are many 
different medication approaches.  Unfortunately, insurers are only looking to save money and they force physicians to use 
medications like fentanyl, methadone, morphine, oxycodone etc.  They only pick the cheapest medications without regard
to opioid potency or the proper regimen and approach.  By saying that treatment is limited by basing it on strength alone,
is saying that the decision making and design of treatment does not matter.  Tolerance does not matter.  Hyperalgesia does
not matter, & when patients are told that they will not be able to try one dose over another, many patients will seek out illicit 
treatment or use heroin, which will only increase the number of overdoses.

As a consultant to the DEA I have reviewed many patient records, and the vast majority overdosed were because they were
addicts and not because they were pain patients.  Doctors were acting like drug dealers, not thoughtful physicians.  I know that if 
medicare autopsied all overdose patients and compared their therapy with their office records, Medicare would find that the 
patients died because they were prescribed drugs because they were addicted and not because of thoughtful oversight and 
medical treatment.  I have reviewed hundreds of cases, and the system, including the CDC has totally ignored the fact that 
overdoses occurred because of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.  If someone suffers with severe pain, they will keep demanding 
treatment for their pain despite having been misdiagnosed by their physician.  If medications are withheld, more surgeries, and
invasive interventions will be the result, and we will see more money spent on useless procedures and complications &
disability due to treatment being diverted to non medication treatment.  As it is, >50% of spine surgeries and invasive procedures
have been deemed inappropriate.  And if the wrong surgery is offered, more misdiagnosis, and mistreatment will occur.
I now work for the county of Santa Clara, & I have seen many people who should never have undergone surgery, but were 
forced to do so because the physician, the insurer, the utilization department all refuse to consider more appropriate medication
management because of opioid phobia.  

Our dilemma will not improve until we institute a global and holistic view in the approach to control medication misuse.  Before 
instituting a system that demands limitation of treatment, Medicare should do an autopsy review, and I am sure that what they ]
will find is that many deaths were due to poor medical care that perpetuated addictive behavior.  Just the fact that Methadone 
is responsible for 25% of the deaths, Fentanyl is responsible for 7000 deaths, & polypharmacy with benzodiazepine mixtures a cause of 70% of deaths will be evident.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0301","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Rick Chavez-CA"

The ""Proposed"" opiate limits of 90 mg (MME) equivalency to morphine is nothing more than a FORCED UNWARRANTED TAPER on the most vulnerable citizens of our community, the seniors, and disabled patient's. This is a very cowardly move by the CMS, and Medicare Part D. In NO other area of Healthcare, or Medicine is a ""ONE SIZE FITS ALL"" approach appropriate or tolerated. Yet, time and time again dosing ""limits"" are trying to be put on opiate medication's and the patient's who need them. I will say the CDC ""VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES"" are just that, ""VOLUNTARY"" guidelines. This new ""proposal"" is making this from ""VOLUNTARY"" INTO A REQUIRED ""MANDATE."" THIS IS GOING WAY TOO FAR. You are creating DIRE STRAITS for these patient's in a very unethical, cruel, and Inhumane way. This will cause an unbelievable amount of backlash, and unorganized chaos in the Medicare Part D RX drug programs and many, many people will have to DIS-ENROLL from Medicare Part D altogether. This is modern day ""PROHIBITION"" on opiates. What is the Goal here? ""The elderly, and disabled are not the ones creating the opiate epidemic.""

Fitting all of these patient's into a one ""generalized box"" no matter what the severity or complexities of their particular health issues and needs along with their individualized pain level and tolerance is, is so completely wrong on so, so many levels. You are playing with people's live's. You are creating illegal drugs to flood our streets, and communities, you are creating patient's who are in downright despair, desperation, and severe uncontrolled pain who are finding no other alternative than to commit suicide. You are leaving patient's in withdrawal's, and severe pain who were once ""functioning"" members of society that are no longer able to work, care for their families, or their children, and who are ""bedridden"" due to decreased functioning because of these unwarranted, unnecessary dose tapers that are being literally forced upon them with such staggering low dose opiate mandates that no one who has been on a higher dose's previously (most for many year's) will be able to tolerate, or whose pain levels will be anywhere near being controlled at these low dose mandates. 

You are allowing these patients to be turned away at their Pharmacies in staggering numbers due to these restriction's who will then be forced into severe withdrawal due to the loss of their medication's coverage. Do you really fully understand the impact this will have?

Furthermore, trying to implement a unrealistic, and unbelievable 7 day opiate prescription supply only? I cannot even begin to understand this, or even fathom this. These are senior's and disabled people we are talking about. Most of these people do not, and cannot even drive. For many they live in rural locations and they must travel 100 miles or more each way to see their Doctor, or healthcare provider. This would cutoff complete access to their opiate prescription's as they do not have the means to travel to their Doctor, or Healthcare provider 4 TIMES A MONTH?  and to have to go through this impossible situation for a year? EVERY YEAR? How can anyone say this is the right thing to do here? Again, Please understand these are Senior Citizen's, and Disabled people we are talking about...these people are not the criminals, drug pushers, and opiate abusers of these medication's that you are clearly trying to make them out to be. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. These are people that desperately need these medication's. They are not out on street corners selling, or peddling their opiate medication's. Most have already been forced into some kind of unwarranted dose tapers. You are going about this issue completely in the wrong way. What choice's are patient's and Doctors being left with? You are trying to implement a situation into where these people are going to lose access to their medication's. This is putting ALL Medicare Part D recipients who are on opiates into DIRE STRAITS. 

So what is the recourse for the senior citizen's and disabled who are on opiate doses greater than 90 MG (MME) Morphine Equivalency most of whom are LONG TERM pain patient's who have been on dose's greater than this for many year's? or those who cannot get access to their Healthcare provider Every 7 day's for a new opiate prescription?

What choice's are they being left with other than to DIS-ENROLL FROM MEDICARE PART D RX DRUG PLAN'S??? Those who need these medication's may not be left with any other choice causing them an undue financial hardship to have to go and seek out alternative Rx drug plans that are NOT controlled by Medicare Part D and who do not impose these kinds of restrictions on opiate medication's. These people are already PAYING to have their Medicare Part D plans. Now they are going to be left with no other choice than to seek out a private RX drug plan. This is LUDICROUS.

"323","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As someone with intractable pain from my many diagnoses, including hip dysplasia, degenerative discs in lower back and neck, three different types of headache/migraine, and many others, if I had to drop down to 90 MME I would be completely bedridden, writhing in pain and most likely screaming. My family does not want this, my doctor does not want this, and I certainly do not want this, but if an insurance company is going to be making medical decisions not knowing me or how my conditions affect me, I may as well prepare for it.
This does absolutely nothing to address the real problem of illicit fentanyl and heroin usage. Pain patients are NOT the problem, but we are being penalized in pretty drastic numbers. Evidence supports a suicide rate of 40 people per day who had been pain patients but were taken off their medications or dropped by their doctors, and quite a few of them are Veterans who should be receiving the best care possible. Addiction rates amongst pain patients hover between 0.2 and 2 percent, but we as a country are going to step back and allow our elderly and disabled to suffer in pain until they can no longer stand it? Is this really the legacy we want to leave our children and grandchildren?
I know this issue is thwarted with controversy, and I know addiction is real. However, by penalizing pain patients and not helping addicts, we are simply shortening life spans and depriving grandchildren of their grandparents because Grammy doesn't get her pain medication so she can't come over anymore/can't get out of bed/can't live with the pain/killed herself due to the ungodly pain levels. I ask that all of you imagine body-wide pain that never goes away, for if these ""rules"" are put into place, you *will* be at that point one day.

The CDC committee was not comprised of any pain management experts or pain patients. It was developed by unscrupulous means, false data and created by those with hidden agendas. Even the CDC has openly admitted that the data used in the making of the guidelines was junk science. It's time for non experts to stop hanging on to this poorly written guideline as law. One size fits all, isn't a good approach to any medical conditions. People metabolize medications differently. Medical conditions are just not the same. My story is like many others and it's not a choice to have to take pain medications. I loved my life and career of 30 years but then I was hit by a drunk driver. I already suffered from Syringomyelia, an extremely painful spinal cord disease. I also have a theathered spinal cord, busted fusion in my neck, bad disks in the lower back and a traumatic brain injury. I now live, and will have to live with intractable chronic pain for the rest of my life. There is no known cure for this disease and it's my medications that allow me any sense of normalcy or partial quality of life. I've been on the same dose of medications for a very long time. Believe me, it's not the chronic pain patient who is selling their medications or causing the addictions in this country. Limiting pain medications will not only increase the suicide rates but those who endure the pain will become more of a burden on the Medicare and or Medicaid system because they will need help with daily functional living needs. The guidelines set by the CDC, by their own acknowledgement, are based on junk science, so why are you declaring implementation as a way to stop or even lessen drug abusers? The real data shows, prescription drugs are less available and yet overdoses have still increased. The data also never accounts for the whole picture. We are an aging society, so the increase of opioid use over the years also comes with an increase of aging baby boomers hitting their golden yet painful years. Narcotic drug use by medical patients and illegal drug abuse information is lumped together and there is a huge difference between prescription drug use and street drug abuse. A lot was accomplished with driving down real prescription drug abuse and diversion by implementation of the monitoring systems that stoped doctor shopping, urinalysis for patient compliance, and drug store monitoring. We now need to stop the Illegal drugs! Placing a blanket one size fits all limit of medications on all chronically ill pain patients will only harm millions whom already have it bad enough. Where is the supporting data that says this is a good way to combat addiction and overdoses? What happened to do no harm? Doctors know their patients and have been with them for years and know what's best for them individually, not some branch of government. There are 10s of thousands of people with incurable diseases beyond cancer and who tried everything else prior to pain medications and are stable on their current doses. Uncontrolled pain causes havoc on the body. This is a form of genocide and discrimination to the disabled, the rules/laws need to be made with all opposing view points pain management doctors and pain patients need to be a large part of the decision making process along with real true data that's from neutral or unbiased sources as data can be manipulated to fit any agenda if used in unscrupulous ways. I use to be a Quality Engineer so I understand the manipulation of data. Why are you hurting the ones already hurting? How is limiting daily amounts of medicines for intractable pain patients going to fix illegal drug abuse? Are we going to limit the amount of insulin a diabetic can take, heart medications for heart patients etc.? When are we going to go after the true cause of this all the overdoses, illegal  drugs and the dealers and leave the true pain patients alone? Time for a new approach. It's time to deal with the root cause, true facts and correct the real issue. The people dying are those using illegal drugs or taking prescription drugs illegally. Please stop moving forward only seeing one side, making up or manipulating data and taking a lazy approach to solving a problem. The real numbers are in, prescriptions are down but overdoses are up. Why are we doing such a bad job at stoping cartel and drug dealers? Dealers will continue to deal and junkies will continue to get high and overdoses will continue to rise. This is a horrendous job, if those responsible for this poor decision worked for a major corporation and failed at correcting the cause of this problem, spending millions, for so long and not listening to reason, or even attempting a new solution they'd be fired. I beg of you please correct the real problem and leave compliant pain patients and pain management doctors alone. Very respectfully, Debbie

Over the past 17 years I have had over 29 surgeries, 9 on them on my spine, the remainder on joints, and a multitude of other health issues. My spine was fragmenting and it couldnt be stopped so they fused it both from the front and back basically building a wall around it to keep it secure. However it continues to degenerate and I live with alot of nuts and screws and plates holding it together, that in itself is painful, I have screws goign down into my SI joints and have SI joint dysfunction along with RA and Failed Spine Surgery Syndrome. I currently have another herniated disc, bulging disc and nerve damage. I live with chronic pain every day of my life but have never asked for a higher dose of pain medication, nor have I have lost a prescription, ran out of drugs early. My opioids give me some relief from the suffering. However due to this war against humanity, I am now being taken off my pain meds and my pain has increased, I have had to get help to get off the toilet. I used to be able to do that alone. I have no other options, I have been through every type of treatment, been through PT, so many injections of steroids I couldn't begin to count. I am no longer a candidate for further surgery due to my risk of infection so I will continue to fall apart and now I will do that without the relief of the pain meds that once made my life bearable, they gave me the ability to stand on my own two feet, to go to the bathroom by myself, now I can barely walk. I just want to be a daughter, a mother and a grandmother. To take part in my families lives instead of being stuck in my home because my pain is so unbearable I cant get myself up to join the world. WHERE IS THE HUMANITY IN THIS? THIS IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE POOR AND DISABLED

Opioids have given me some quality of life, made it so that I can walk, I can stand up so that I can toilet myself
These proposed regulations are not supported by any real science
If enacted doctors will be forced away from treating people like me, making us suffer, going against their Hippocratic Oath to DO NO HARM
If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day this will give insurance companies and pharmacies an excuse to stop paying for my necessary medications
Ive already been reading articles about chronic pain patients committing suicide rather than dealing with their pain situation, is this what our government really wants? Are you just trying to weed out this population of the damaged and the suffering? thats how it seems, get rid of the suffering...

I recently read a post somewhere that had something from the Declaration of Montreal and it said that 
WITHHOLDING PAIN TREATMENT IS PROFOUNDLY WRONG
THAT WITHHOLDING SUCH TREATMENT LEADS TO UNNECESSARY SUFFERING
THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAIN TREATMENT WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION
IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE-NOT INHIBIT-THE ACCESS OF PEOPLE IN PAIN TO FULLY ADEQUATE PAIN TREATMENT

Please reconsider-there has to be other options that doesnt hurt those that havent done anything wrong, all we do is try to make it from one day to the next-take the time to find a better way-slow down-stop causing more pain, start thinking about the BIG picture-

I am a 49 year old disabled civilian who suffers daily from multiple painful disabling conditions.  After working in a high tech career for 25 years (23 at Microsoft, 2 at Amazon) I became too disabled to work due to Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibromyalgia, and Crohn's disease.   The pain from these conditions is literally crippling: I was a approved for SSDI in 2015 after I stopped working - reluctantly, unwillingly - in 2013.  Consequently I became a Medicare patient in late 2015, again - unwillingly.  I would prefer to be paying for my previous individual health insurance plan but that's not allowed with SSDI for some illogical reason.   I have been on long-term, extended-release opioid medications under the careful supervision of pain specialist for more than 10 years.

The CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines released in 2016 are VOLUNTARY, and only intended for primary care physicians.   Making the *arbitrary* dosage limits included in the CDC guidelines mandated limit for ALL patients and providers is INHUMANE and DRACONIAN.    Yes there is an exception process - but having recently been a victim of a Part D insurer's automatic denial of my medications and having to navigate the prior-authorization process?  When ALL people on Part D have that automatic limit enforced at once then all pharmacy business will grind to a halt, all prescribing physicians will spent dozens of hours on paperwork and phone calls, and the net result will be millions of people in severe, untreated pain while the 'process' crawls through its inevitable conclusion.  

When CMS notified the Part D insurers back in 2017 that they had authority to routinely deny ALL opioid prescriptions above an arbitrary dosage I am certain that those insurers rejoiced wholeheartedly.   They were given permission to deny MILLIONS of prescriptions to people in pain; to overrule the medical judgement of physicians all over the country; and to intentionally increase their revenue by denying claims - while asserting that it was for the good of the people.     

I know this because my own Part D insurer - Humana - denied coverage for my routine, monthly pain medications last month.  I've been disabled and had the same prescriptions for years.       I rely on pain medication in order to get out of bed, to tend to my service dog, to bathe, to prepare meals - without relief from the constant and severe pain caused by my incurable conditions I would have no life at all.   I'm never NOT in pain - but the opioid medication sometime allow me to push the consciousness of that pain to my subconscious at least temporarily.    I can sometimes be productive.    Without the medication I would need full-time care which I cannot afford.

Last month my local pharmacy was apologetic when they informed me that my Part D insurer had denied my pain medication prescriptions.   It took weeks to unravel the mess.   My doctor spent hours on the phone, increasingly enraged at the insurer's untrained and inept staff, their lack of understanding of their OWN POLICIES, and his frustration at simply trying to authorize the same medications he's deemed medically-appropriate for me for years.   My pharmacist similarly spent hours on the phone with them.  As did I.   It's madness.

You stated in the notice that CMS was aware that insurers exceeded the intention of this limit.   Of course they did.  If you authorize insurance companies to deny medically-appropriate prescriptions it will not matter what the intention is - to provoke conversation between providers and patients?  Irrelevant.  Part D insurers won't need a reason to deny, they'll just do it.  And they'll make it difficult to override.   Because they already are.

We understand that people want to do things to limit the addiction/overdose crisis.   The crisis is caused by heroin and fentanyl not prescription drugs.  You need to consider what happens to legitimate patients in pain under this scenario, and it's not good.   The most medically-fragile people in our country are already struggling to retain access to treating providers, insurance, and access to pain medications.   Don't weaponize Part D insurance against them.

"336","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Dear CMS,

I am writing on behalf of millions of patients in chronic pain, intractable pain and palliative care who are dependent (not addicted, but dependent) on opioids above 90MME/day, to have any quality of life, and for some of them, any life at all. 

I have been a caregiver for an intractable pain patient who is also a family member, for more than twenty years. I have seen first hand the absolute DEVASTATION that uncontrolled pain causes not only for the patient, but for the entire family. 

It is barbaric and INHUMANE to deny pain relief to someone when it is available, because it exceeds some arbitrary number with no scientific basis. 

My loved one daily begged to be put out of their misery, as they suffered needlessly for more than ten years, because of a pain doctor who was afraid of the DEA. And this was BEFORE the cruel and oppressive CDC Guidelines for Opioid Prescribing, which has now become ""mandate,"" not just for primary care doctors, as the ""suggestions"" were intended for, but now even in pain clinics staffed with board-certified physicians. 

By the grace of God, with full-time 24/7 care, my loved one survived, and was finally provided with blessed pain relief. The doctor God used to help my family member CARED and my loved one had better pain control in three months than they had experienced for ten full years before. Now there is a clear dividing line in their life and their immediate family's life  before the pain was relieved, and since. 

My loved one lost ten entire years of life for no other reason than FEAR. Our family lost many years. Children grew up without knowing this family member, because the pain was so severe, visits were near impossible. They missed everything...graduations, church, family reunions, birthday parties, cookouts and more. Were the pain not relieved just in time, they would have missed their own mother's funeral. For ten solid, horrible years, their pain was too severe and out of control for them to sit through a service (church or funeral). They slept for only 2 hours at a time, sleep only coming after pure exhaustion finally allowed it, despite the pain.

Millions of people suffer from this type of pain - pain that is CONSTANT and SEVERE. In these cases, opioid medications have been a literal lifesaver. The 90MME/day ""suggestion"" in the CDC Guidelines has no scientific basis and no insurance company or pharmacist should have the right to make judgments about how much medicine a particular patient needs. 

If your proposals are carried out, millions of intractable pain patients, primarily senior citizens, disabled people and the poor will be unable to obtain medicines that they must have, in order to survive. Private insurance companies will follow suit, putting the entire United States chronic pain population in dire straits, as if things were not already bad enough for them. [Just as pain specialists followed suit after the CDC Guidelines for Opiod Prescribing were implemented, the guidelines having become ""mandate"" rather than ""suggestions"" for primary care doctors.]

Who does HIPPA apply to? What good is it, if insurance companies and pharmacies are now going to ""invite themselves"" into private appointments? Physicians, the ones that are left and haven't yet buckled under the pressure, are doing their best to give their patients some quality of life, or life at all. Doctors are already drowning in regulations and paperwork and should not be required to spend their time calling insurance companies to justify their decision of what medicine a patient needs, and how much.

Pharmacies are already denying valid prescriptions to patients who need them and this regulation will only make it worse. These patients will go from the frying pan and into the fire. Suicides among patients in chronic pain will increase and the blood will be on your hands. 

It was not CDC's role, nor is it CMS's role to decide how much medicine people are ""allowed"" to have, irrespective of their history, their pain, their metabolism or ay of the other myriad things involved in the treatment plan of each INDIVIDUAL patient. One size will never fit all, despite the propaganda that PROP continues to parrot. The government does not allow it's animals to be treated as inhumanely as patients in pain are being treated. The madness must stop.

GUIDELINE FOR PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS FOR CHRONIC PAIN- CDC
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/guideline.html

Welcome to the Wisconsin Enhanced Prescription Drug Monitoring Program

Differentiation must be made between heroin, fentanyl and other illegal use  and legally prescribed medications. 

Synthetic opioids like fentanyl cause about a third of overdose deaths, heroin causes about a fourth, and prescription opioids cause 23 percent, down from 26 percent in 2009.

Even more importantly, studies show the majority of people prescribed opioids   do NOT become addicted. 

Other research has shown that 75 percent of all opioid misuse starts with medication NOT prescribed to them.

I have been on the SAME dose of opioid meds for 17 years (NOT the behavior or an addict), so I'm sure you know it does NOT take away my pain, but it allows me to MANAGE it so that I at least have a decent Quality of Life and am a contributing member of society. Without this medication, I would be confined to bed...period...NO LIFE AT ALL! And that's not to speak for what disability and constant pain does to family members who are, most of the time, unfortunate caregivers. It destroys the entire family unit.

PLEASE, DO NOT limit dosage to 90 mg. and put limits on the length of time patients can take their pain relief meds. Do NOT ""play doctor!"" I can't even believe that such a thing as what you are proposing is allowed to happen in this great country of ours. Doctor/Patient rapport is, and should be, SACRED. Each patient is an individual and must be treated accordingly. And while some people like myself can get away with less than your proposed limit, people like my sister (who was in a horrendous car accident years ago) absolutely cannot. We are NOT addicts! We do NOT take our meds to get high! That is the definition of a true addict--taking meds for the effect it gives, not the pain relief. We take our meds responsibly, just like we do our blood pressure (and other) meds every single day. We submit to the required regular drug testing; have regular visits with our doctors, etc. WHY are we being punished? Not one of the alleged surveys, research, reports, ""scientific data"" that I have seen has been without prejudice or convoluted in some way to meet the needs of the individual or group that has supported this ""opioid epidemic."" And the media---don't get me started on that! They have told only ONE SIDE of the story so far...disgraceful! The epidemic of OD's is NOT with the chronic, intractable pain patient. It is with ILLEGAL FENTANYL & HEROIN on the STREETS!! THESE are the people you should be targeting, NOT legitimate pain patients who are only begging for a decent Quality of Life!

And...people are SO DISTRAUGHT by the CDC, DEA & FDA's position on this issue that they are taking to COMMITTING SUICIDE, as more and more doctors are leaving pain management behind and blatantly abandoning pain patients, without even giving them their rightful medicinal treatment of detoxing before dismissal! Tons of these people (baby boomers) are now senior citizens, who do not know how to advocate for themselves and they are DESPERATE, feeling totally abandoned by the very government they have supported their entire lives. HOW can you people LIVE with yourselves?

If what you propose is instituted, more and more doctors will be frightened away from treating pain; more people will end up in emergency rooms and having cost-prohibitive procedures, skyrocketing insurance costs even further. In addition, more people will end up on Social Security Disability and Medicaid; and, worst case scenario, there will be MORE SUICIDES! More families will be destroyed! To top it off, it WILL NOT deter your so-called ""opioid epidemic"" in any way, shape or form. More and more drugs cross the border every day; the drug cartels are rejoicing that you are targeting pain patients--there will be more people  going to the streets for their drugs because they cannot get them legitimately from their doctors anymore! WHAT is wrong with THIS picture?

Again, please rethink your proposed CDC Guidelines and the further imposition of mandated limits on legitimate opioid prescriptions being made by caring, compassionate, knowledgeable pain management doctors, who are being targeted for nothing more than doing the job that they TOOK AN OATH to do, without prejudice and, above all, TO DO NO HARM.

Get law enforcement out on the STREETS, to prosecute the drug dealers who are not only corrupting our youth, but destroying our country and, in the process, killing people who are already suffering unbelievably in pain!

Dear Ms. Seema Verma,

Novo Nordisk Inc. (""Novo Nordisk"") appreciates the opportunity to comment on the 2019 Advance Notice and draft Call Letter (the draft Call Letter). Headquartered in Denmark, and with almost 5,000 U.S. employees, Novo Nordisk is a global health care company with 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes, obesity, hemophilia and growth hormone disorders. Novo Nordisk is committed to the goal of ensuring patients have access to high-quality, affordable health care, and to improving patient protections in health insurance coverage. 

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS' efforts to promote and enhance the quality of health plan offerings in both the MA and Part D programs. Our comment letter addresses the following points: 

	Novo Nordisk supports the adoption of a new measure for 2019 Star Ratings, ""Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes,"" but encourages additional emphasis on the link between cardiovascular disease and diabetes through future measure development.
	Novo Nordisk supports CMS' proposal to delay the summer formulary update window from July to late summer to allow plan sponsors to include newly approved drugs in 2019 bids. Novo Nordisk also supports the proposal to add two new enhancement-only windows in fall 2018 and January 2019 that will feed into the Medicare Plan Finder and ensure beneficiaries have the most current information. 

Novo Nordisk addresses these comments in more detail below.


Section I - Parts C and D: 
Enhancements to the 2019 Star Ratings and Future Measurement Concepts - New Measures for 2019 Star Ratings
Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) (Part D)

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS for the adoption of a Star Ratings Measure for 2019 to support statin use in persons living with diabetes. Statin use in patients living with diabetes is an evidence-based standard of care. The adoption of this Star Ratings measure will align with both the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of medical care in diabetes.  Patients with Type 2 diabetes have an increased prevalence of lipid abnormalities, contributing to their high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in subjects with and without coronary heart disease.  The USPSTF recommends that adults without a history of CVD (i.e., symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke) use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: 1) they are ages 40 to 75 years; 2) they have 1 or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking); and 3) they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater.  The USPSTF has rated statin use in patients with diabetes with ""B"" grade.  This grade denotes that the USPSTF recommends the service and there is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate.  The ADA recommends statin use of varying levels of intensity in all patients with diabetes (barring medical conditions resulting in a contraindication of statin use), recognizing that CVD is a dangerous co-morbidity of diabetes that must be appropriately treated.  

Novo Nordisk applauds CMS for updating the 2019 Star Ratings to include this measure on statin use as the measure aligns with evidence-based care and is in tune with the medical community's views on diabetes care. However, we encourage CMS to consider funding additional measure development that focuses more specifically on the link between CVD and diabetes. The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is four times greater in people living with type 2 diabetes as compared to those without diabetes.  About 70% of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, making it the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes.  Specifically, we encourage CMS to promote the development and implementation of a diabetes & CVD composite measure that focuses on overlapping treatment processes and goals. Such a measure could focus on aspects of health care such as blood pressure screening and control, lipid screening and control, and tobacco cessation. 

Section III - Part D, Formulary Submissions
CY 2019 Formulary Submission Window

Novo Nordisk supports CMS' decision to delay the summer formulary update window and to add a Medicare Plan Finder update window in the fall and a formulary update window in January of the coverage year. These important update opportunities will allow for improved beneficiary transparency, which will help ensure beneficiaries can make informed enrollment decisions based on the most up-to-date information and that their chosen plan best meets their coverage and affordability needs. 


Sincerely,
 
Tricia Brooks
Vice President, Public Affairs
Novo Nordisk Inc.

I require 24 hour, around the clock Fentanyl Patch. This proposed reduction is both unhelpful and risky. I have already had my break thru medications reduced. I cannot take NSAID due to a history of ulcers using Celebrex. Nor can I take aspirin for this same reason. The FDA never approved the Guidelines that recommend a reduction in daily MME. Taking opioids at a 90MME daily allowed me to work an additional year but that was against my surgeons advice. I am not a candidate for spinal cord stimulator because the risk of infection is high and could cause me to lose my right leg where a total hip replacement was done prior to my two spinal surgeries. People that are suffering from intractable pain that have had their opioids reduced are committing suicide. Most, if not all of the chronic pain patients know that the CDC was hoodwinked by people like Andrew Kolodny that have a vested interest in addiction centers. NO PAIN MANAGMENT PROFESSIONAL WAS CONSULTED WHEN THESE GUIDELINES WERE CREATED.  These actions are causing doctors to drop out of pain management due to over-reach of the DEA. How can someone with 12 months training be allowed to sideline a physician with more than a decade of professional training? Where has common sense gone?

I am an Extremly Drug Sensitive person, my reaction sheet I have to submit to my 4 Specialist, Cardiologist, ENDO, GASTRO, and Neurologist, is a full type written sheet long, many cause ER trips for A-Fib as I have an Enlarged Heart with a small Mitral Valve leak. Osteoarthritis drugs Ruined my GI track, long term Nexium use caused Barrett's Esopogus and Gastropresis a delayed digestive disease for which there is NO cure and Osteoprosis. I've been Hypothyroid since I was in my 30's. Now that I'm 69, I'm on regular Medicare and Tricare Life as my husband is a Ret. SCPO with a 20 yr career in the Navy. I also have Diverticulosis and a small Hiatal Hernia. I react badly to Osteoprosis drugs.  Because I have Gastropreis I can only take a  class 1 or 2 Opioid very infrequently. So I really have no pain releif other than for the Fibromyalgia and the Perpherial Neuropathy. I am NOT a candiate for back surgery due to Osteoprosis -4. On Dec. 29, 2017, the UNDER EDUCATED APN who suddenly became my Primary refused to renew my perscription of the one Class 4 medication Valium 10 mg twice per day that is used to treat the Fibromyalgia and Perpherial Neuropathy. and controls the Meniere's attacks as Meclizine does not work. I've had 12 reactions to drugs like Lyrica, Neurotin, Cymbalta all causing ER trips for A-Fib with the first two requiring hospital stays. On Jan 2, 2018 I was forced to call my Cardio for a Hypertension medication as the FORCED NOT TAPER of my Valium by this UNDER EDUCATED APN forced my BP into Hypertension range and required a Beta Channel Blocker to lower it to a more reasonable range.

Then I saw my Neuroligist she prescribed Clonazepam 1 mg, two pills later I was in reaction from it, I had no one to drive me to the ER, as neither of us drive at night any longer. If not for the Beta Channel Blocker my BP would have been in Hypertension high range requiring yet another ER trip for A-Fib. Hypertension KILLS. That makes 13 Failed Neuropathy drugs. And Clonazepam is MORE addictive than Valium is. I've been stable on it for nearly 10 yrs, it was prescribed by a now retired Pain Specialist after many attempts to control just two forms of pain failed with horrible reactions. I don't have withdrawal issues, I just get MORE UNCONTROLLED PAIN!

I live in Intractable Pain and have for nearly 30 yrs. Intractable pain, also known as Intractable Pain Disease or IP, is a severe, constant pain that is not curable by any known means and which causes a bed or house-bound state and early death if not adequately treated, usually with opioids and/or interventional procedures.  

I can't even take a baby aspirin due to the ruined GI tract. Ibuprophen or other anti-inflamatories are NOT an Option. Surgery is NOT an Option. 

As I am already on the TRICARE LIFE OPIOID restrictions, adding more Medicare Restrictions, making me a Criminal for being ILL from FDA Approved Drugs for half of those health conditions. That is the EQUVILANT of making me a TOTAL INVALID unable to enjoy even a visit with my grandchildren. Or take a long weekend trip to see my sister whose husband has late stage MD and can't travel well. I will always have PAIN but I expect to at least have enough control over it to not have to take a Hypertension medication.

Your ignoring the factor most OD's are a combo of drugs, booze and ILLEGAL DRUG use. Those drugs flow across our borders via Mexico, M.E. and China where their Fenyatal is stronger than that produced in the USA. Hundreds of Tons of Heroin, Cocaine, Hash, Fenyatal are seized yearly. China even uses our USPS to ship it to the USA where it is laced into the Heroin and Cocaine. 

How many ER trips for A-Fib do I have to make that Medicare and Tricare Life have to cover trying to find a Neuropathy medication? OVER 300 Pain Clinics have shut their doors in Tennessee. I have always been very responsible in the taking and storage of any medication. I know the dangers that adult medications can cause. They are locked up.

YOU ARE PUNISHING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of Legitimate Chronic and Pain Patients for the Irresponsibly acts of a few. This OPIOID CRISIS IS FAKE. We have a ILLEGAL DRUG CRISIS.

"352","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I do not support the time and resources for any measure that attempts to quantify non-adherence for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Any endpoint other than steady state drug level is flawed. Patients have too many ways around even filling but not taking medications. Too many studies have been done including electronic pill dispenser notification and data recording but these too do not mean the patient took the medication or at the suggested time. Given the DOACs have such a short half life - any study on adherence is a mere snapshot for that moment in time. At least for warfarin, the half-life carried patients for as much as a week of some protection against thromboembolism. Spending any resources on short-half lived DOACs will not yield any solutions to the problem of adherence that has gone back to Hypocrites so, funding any effort to capture DOAC adherence is short sighted. It might be a better exercise to evaluate embolic events on patients prescribed DOACs and then, for the survivors consider a well managed warfarin regimen so their drug can be monitored for adherence. 
Studies have show the higher the medication cost the poorer the adherence. Add to this a lack of symptomatic benefit and adherence is likely even worse. For AF, the incidence of stroke is approximately 5%/year for 65 year old patients. Considering the odds of not having a stroke is now 95% and patients will think like people first rather than patients in that ""it won't happen to me"". Asymptomatic, expensive agents will always have an uphill battle to be taken consistently over time. The FDA must have known this before approving these agents but then again - they approved systemic anticoagulants without an anecdote! These drugs were flawed from the beginning, beginning with the manufacturers designing the study, their outcome and funding with most having at least on employee on the advisory board - not so with warfarin.
My preference would be to invest far more into revisiting the cutback of reimbursement for self-testing for warfarin. When managed well, warfarin is as good as any of the DOACs. The ability to measure blood levels is the ONLY metric/endpoint for clinicians to know patients are taking their medication. The recent reduction in reimbursement for the next 2 years will all but stop clinician's support of patients self-testing their INR. 
My recommendation? Invest any money available to support PST for affordable warfarin for all Medicare/Medicaid patients. Why? CMS already reviewed and approved the many studies of PST and CMS already has an affordable, effective drug that can be easily monitored - it simply needs tweaks to its management which includes a weekly testing frequency, consistent with the drug's half-life.  
As thought leader and VA Affairs Alan Jacobson, MD has said, ""we don't need more anticoagulants, we just need to better manage the drug we have.""  Could not agree more. As I've always said and that will always be the case:  Patients are People first - people are generally non-adherent and often think it 'won't happen to them'.

Every treatment was tried including: numerous rounds of PT, chiro, accupuncture, dry needling, rolfing, massage, multiple steroid injections, multiple blocks, nerve ablation, finally surgery. The surgery was botched, my neck structure significantly damaged, constant nerve pain, spasms/muscle cramps, I can't turn my head as I have no range of motion. Too many of us, intractable pain patients, after being stable for years, are being involuntarily tapered because a group of biased individuals decided a one size all approach to Intractable pain. Studies have show we are all different, we metabolize medication differently. Our pains are different, we handle pain in individual ways. I'm begging Congress/legislation to understand that for some of us, we've tried everything. I don't care if my body becomes dependent. It already is to the antidepressants, CNS medications I'm on; likely more so than my opiates. I've accepted I will live with pain the rest of my life, please be compassionate enough to allow me the opportunity to have some relief. We lose so much when our body becomes distorted from how God intended in our creation. God doesn't intend for those with pain to suffer. I was successful in the corporate world, climbing my way to a senior management position, earning a six figure income. I loved my work, my co-workers. I was very proud of my accomplishments. I've lost my ability to socialize, to attend functions; other than my family I've lost just about everything.
 Focus on illicit medications, focus on addicts seeking a high. They truly need help, I've witnessed the destruction. I've seen the death in an addicts eyes.
Leave us with Intractable pain out of your equations.

"358","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"At what point is anyone going to bring the patient's point of view into this discussion?  We do realize that those who make these rules do not have to live by them.  

People in acute pain do not have the time or the energy needed to fight stupidity.  Dealing with pain intermittently is bad enough.  Those in constant pain have doctors who have managed their case and know what they are doing.  The doctors know far more about pain control than any government agency headed up by people who promote the fortunes of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  

The problem with opioids is not with pain patients.  It is with addicts.  Addicts who overdose (OD) on their recreational drugs are not patients; they are addicts with no medical supervision.  Some may be taking other drugs replacing opioids, but even those drugs are addicting.

It is long past time that the difference between pain control patients and addicts be handled as differently as the two situations.  An addict overdoses and an expensive drug is given to reverse the OD, but the addicts goes out and looks for more ""dope"" almost immediately.  The pain patient, on the other hand, must follow the doctor's instructions or run out of medication and live in pain until the next appointment.

You are planning to punish those who have done no wrong.  The opioids causing the problems are not legally license medications.  They are the illegal drugs coming into the USA from overseas through our ports and across the borders.

Before trying to take away relief from legitimate patients, clean up our ports and actually punish those who are being paid to look the other way.

I work closely with my doctor and have tried many options for pain control. I have a ""toolbox"" of options and use whatever option fits the moment. Included in my toolbox are Dilaudid (an opioid for pain), Tizanadine (muscle relaxer), Ativan (stress & anxiety), marijuana (pain and anxiety), and Kratom (pain). I have never become addicted to any substance in my life. I'm very open with my doctors. I am in regular counseling due to the very difficult life of living with chronic pain. In spite of all the rx tools and the other pain management tools I use (biofeedback, massage, TENS unit, topical ointments, heat, etc.) I am never without pain. Not ever. I have been in pain 24/7 for 28 years. Pain management keeps me alive. Without it I couldn't tolerate the suffering and would end my life just for relief. This daily fight to function in spite of pain is exhausting and massively depressing (which I also am being treated for). I rarely use opioids because I know it's like pulling teeth to get a prescription. I treat them like gold and use only in emergancy. I rely more often on marijuana and kratom. But now AG Sessions and the FDA are pressing me into a corner on those options too. Opioids, marijuana and kratom are the most effective options I have for pain treatment. Sadly they are also the most frowned on. If these are taken away from me and I'm left with only what remains in my toolbox, I won't be able to survive. I know the pressure to stop prescribing opioids is an effort to save lives. But I, as a disabled person, deserve to live too. But I can't do it alone. I need your support, help and compassion. Please please instruct the CDC to tell doctors they WILL  NOT lose there jobs due to treating pain patients. Please distinguish between the legitimate treatment of pain patients and the overdose deaths caused by illicit Fentanyl from overseas and illicit heroin. Even the CDC says the opioid crisis is really an illicit Fentenyl and heroin crisis. Many pain patients are killing themselves in desparation. I don't want to be one of them. Please advocate for us too! And please remember that hen you add restrictions for us that cause more doctor visits, you are costing us more money for transportation, office fees and energy. For pain patients like me who live in poverty and whose best function is to shower, toilet and feed myself, such expenditures of energy contribute to much more time in bed recouperating. Ugh. Please, I want to live and function the very best I'm able. I'm trying. I really am. But I need your help. I need to continue to use Dilaudid, marijuana and kratom.

"360","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"New Measures for 2019 Star Ratings:

PacificSource Health Plans is supportive of the addition of Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) (Part D) and Statin Therapy for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (SPC) (Part C) with a measure weight of 1 each for 2019 Stars. However, PacificSource would encourage CMS to refrain from increasing the measure weight of SUPD to 3 in 2020 Stars and instead continue with weight of 1 for at least 2021 Star Ratings in order to allow increased insight of the measure.  
Additionally since only one fill of the Statin drug is required to close the gap, the SUPD measure is similar to a process measure such as MTM CMR completion rate rather than a rating based on clinical outcomes.  Therefore, PacificSource would encourage CMS to consider addition of the following denominator exceptions to SUPD measure: Hypersensitivity to a statin such as angioedema, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure and/or myopathy. 

Improvement measures (Part C & D): Medication Adherence (ADH) for Hypertension (RAS Antagonists), Medication Adherence for Diabetes Medications (Part D):

PacificSource Health Plans is supportive of CMS's proposal to incorporate the updated Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) specifications regarding the exclusion criteria for ESRD and in-patient hospital stays for the Part D adherence measures as well as expansion of the data sources used to identify these measure exclusions. 
PacificSource Health Plans would also encourage CMS to consider addition of denominator exception for RAS Antagonists for when a provider discontinues RAS antagonist due to the patient reaching the treatment goal based on current hypertension guidelines. These measure enhancements would be expected to improve the accuracy. 

Forecasting to 2020 and Beyond:

Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Program Completion Rate for Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMR) Measure (Part D):
PacificSource Health Plans would encourage CMS to move away from the current MTM process measure and consider inclusion of outcome based MTM measures in the Star Ratings Program as developed by the PQA.

Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Program Completion Rate for Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMR) Measure (Part D). The PQA updated this measure for 2018 to include a new denominator exception as follows: For patients eligible for CMR with fewer than 61 days of continuous enrollment in the MTM program: Exclude them from the denominator if they did not receive a CMR within this timeframe. Include them in the denominator and the numerator if they received a CMR within this timeframe.
PacificSource Health Plans agrees with the clarification on the denominator exception as it allows plans to get credit or CMRs completed in the last 2 months of the year


Transitions of Care measure with four indicators: 1. Notification of Inpatient Admission: Documentation of primary care practitioner
notification of inpatient admission on the day of admission or the following day. 2. Receipt of Discharge Information: Documentation of primary care practitioner receipt of specific discharge information on the day of discharge or the following day. 3. Patient Engagement After Inpatient Discharge: Documentation of patient engagement (e.g., office visits, visits to the home, or telehealth) provided by primary care practitioner within 30 days after discharge. 4. Medication Reconciliation Post-Discharge (which is currently a HEDIS measure): Documentation of medication reconciliation within 30 days of discharge. The intent of the measure is to improve the quality of care transitions from an inpatient setting to home. We plan to propose to include this measure with the four indicators on the 2020 display measure for possible inclusion in the 2022 Star Rating.

Less than .01% in the United States are addicted & abuse opioid based drugs according to the NIH study reporting 2,000,000 opioid addicts.

These attacks against our doctors and our ability to receive legitimate pain medications, not the illegal stuff on the streets coming from Mexico & China, amounts to medical genocide against the weakest among us; the elderly, cancer patients & disabled.

The CMS plans for opioid prescribing could negatively impact their quality of life, including their ability to enjoy retirement, spend time with family, and pursue personal activities. 

The 2017 CDC Annual Surveillance Report of Drug-Related Risks and Outcome clearly states that ""Prescription opioid pain relievers were formerly driving the crisis, but by 2015 they shared equal measure with heroin, synthetic opioids other than methadone (mostly illicit fentanyl), andincreasingly cocaine and methamphetamines."" So while securing the prescription opioids against theft or diversion remains an important issue, pain management for people with major disorders who either cannot use other medications or are not gaining good relief is also important. 

The potential efficacy of medications like tramadol, oxycodone, and other opioids in chronic pain management is well established. From Cochrane reviews to policy statements from the Mayo Clinic, there is medical value here. The under-treatment of pain among the elderly is already a problem, and the opioid crisis is impacting cancer pain care and hospice care, too. 

I hope that CMS reach more reasonable prescribing practices for a group of people who are in general at very low risk of medication abuse or addiction and who are already enduring or at high risk of developing painful medical conditions. Please feel free to contact me regarding the above-cited information. I can provide references, additional information, or further analysis.

2017-0163 is Unhelpful and Risky: Pain patients are being cut off by their doctors as Illicit Fentanyl is flooding our streets, killing people. It is being disguised as Percocet (killed Eric Chase Bolling, Prince etc) Xanax, Vicodin, Oxycontin and is killing innocent people. Funny as this drug entered the US, pain doctors began to cut off their long term pain patients. People are in agony, giving up committing suicide. 
 
This policy will affect up to 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries who received >120 MME for at least one day (per the Proposal), and far more than the 500,000 chronically dosed at >120 MME for at least 3 months, according to the HHS Office of the Inspector General 
 
While I agree that excess opioid prescribing over the last 15 years was adverse and required correction what you are proposing is barbaric. People can't find pain management specialists now. 

This will accelerate forced dose reductions. People are being cut off now as doctors abandon them. Is what you are intending? Death?

Millions of patients are experiencing forcible dose reductions or curtailment in otherwise stable patients that have become common as prescribers react to regulations, mandates, insurers and fear for professional security. There is anecdotal evidence of harm (emotional trauma, medical or psychiatric deterioration, suicide, that I  believe the CMS proposal will accelerate
 
The policy does not agree with the 2016 CDC Guideline on Prescribing Opioids  
The dose thresholds featured in the Guideline's statement pertain specifically to dose escalation from a dose below to a dose beyond the threshold
. An evaluation of harm and benefit should guide care.The doctor should decide care not the government
 
This proposal does not consider adverse impacts on pharmacies, physicians or patients in the context of multiple regulatory initiatives, and it will accelerate patient abandonment  

The appeal mechanism proposed by CMS calls for payers to accept a simple attestation that a higher dose is ""medically necessary"". The doctor wouldn't have written prescription if it wasn't necessary. It entails 3 and 4-way communication between pharmacy, Prior Authorization management contractors (e.g. Magellan), doctors' offices and insurers. The labor is substantial and uncompensated. Worse, the CMS proposal does not in any way provide the targeted case management for truly high-risk patients that was recommended by the OIG. The CMS plan risks accelerating abandonment and medical harm to patients who receive opioids as physicians flee an increasingly risk-laden and cumbersome decision matrix that may not advance patient safety.

A 48% reduction in high dose prescribing since 2010  has not been accompanied by a reduction in the number of deaths A focus on prescription reduction, absent patient outcome assessment, is inadequate.
 
Regarding the 7-day limit the CMS plan allows no exceptions even for patients with suspected metastatic cancer, or hospice, and merits reconsideration.

Bill is a 58-year-old male with a history of head and neck cancer as well as chronic low back pain who presents to his new primary care doctor for a routine checkup and visit for a medication his new primary care doctor discusses his current medication regimen with him  ibuprofen 400mg TID and oxycodone 15mg BID. His physician expresses significant concern with his medication regimen, telling Bill that ""it's against the rules"" to continue prescribing opioids for him  despite the fact that he's been on this dose for several years.
I'm outraged that a doctor would straightforwardly lie straight to a patient's face. That doctor knew darn well that it was NOT ""against the rules"", but rather an organizational policy, too risky, or just too darn much paperwork to prescribe opioids these days.
She prescribes an oxycodone taper for him and requests he return to her office in two weeks for a re-evaluation.Bill, not wanting to be a problem, takes his taper as prescribed for the first few days. However, as he's been on opioids for over five years, he begins feeling sick  nausea, vomiting, malaise, and irritability.While trying to work at a construction site, Bill is having trouble completing his tasks and drops a few expensive objects.Bill realizes he cannot work given how he feels and contacts his old oncologist for help. His oncologist provides him with a small prescription for oxycodone, which he fills.Bill feels better and is able to get through to his primary care follow-up visit.Bill lets his new primary care doctor know about what happened: the withdrawal, not being able to work and how he had to get a refill from his oncologist.
the patient isn't hiding what he did, but is trying to explain to his doctor how badly he needs opioid pain medication to function in his life. And for that, he will be punished.
The doctor expresses extreme concern about his ""drug seeking"" and ""doctor shopping"" and tells him he is fired as a patient. He is discharged from the practice.
How can it be ethical (or even legal) to abandon patients like this?
Out of opioids and feeling sick again, he presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of ""medication refill.""
Was there any reason to taper him?

Nowadays, the biggest reason to taper patients is to achieve good metrics and avoid DEA harassment.
No one seems concerned that this happened without a corresponding decrease in reported pain, that pain relief was withheld from those that depended on it to function in their everyday lives.

Going forward, it is best practice to avoid starting an opiate nave patient on opiates for chronic nonterminal pain. However, what do we do with patients like Bill?

While some of these patients have struggled with addiction to their opioids, others  like Bill  have been stable on a particular dose of opioids

It seems absurd to ask doctors to ""carefully assess risk"" when these patients have been compliant for years and sometimes decades, achieving reasonable pain relief.

This is proof that they aren't at risk. 

The risk comes before a patient starts opioid therapy when we don't know how they'll react. Reducing a patient's pain medication as ""general policy"" when these patients have proven not be 
It is important to realize that not every patient on long-term opioid therapy is an addict.
I'm dismayed that this is not absolutely obvious to doctors.
and that some people can be stable, without addiction, on long-term opioid therapy
Have they been so brainwashed by the unscientific potifications of ""experts"" and anti-opioid media hysteria that they really believe opioids somehow ""cause"" addiction in everyone?
Patients without major risk factors for addiction and who do not show signs of developing addiction could be just simply maintained on the opioid regimen that works for them, with regular check-ins to ensure that they are still doing well with their treatment.
This is what a doctor is supposed to do: evaluate the individual's situation to create an individual treatment plan that is effective for this particular patient. If the patient has achieved benefit from a treatment and isn't affected by its known potential side-effects, then it is appropriate medical practice toabruptly tapering or discontinuing opioid therapy in such patients  without first developing a plan with the patient or other providers - is bound to cause problems with uncontrolled pain and withdrawal, as we saw with our patient Bill.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0083","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Dr Coleman-CA"

I have had multiple surgeries to correct what was broken and have compartment syndrome along with hardware keeping my leg together. in addition to the chronic pain caused by this accident that has followed me for eleven years and debilitated my life to an extent that has removed much of anything other than ever increasing amounts of pain to my life. They are now looking into a new diagnosis, not to replace the former but adding to the former. It is believed that I have spinal stenosis caused by the shortening of the injured leg among other things. In the past six months I have gone from an okay life - being able to be active for about 10 hours per day down to about 4 and I cannot travel long distances without extreme pain. I only take 40 to 60mg MME a day and this does very little to remove pain - mostly just taking the edge off and allowing my to function somewhat okay - in the last few months it has become intolerable and every step is agony even on the 40-60 MME per day. I am only 41 - I would like to live a decently long life and see my son graduate from college and get married - maybe even meet a grandkid or two - If I am no longer able to bring the pain level down to about a 4 of constant, daily pain - I will choose to relieve the burden of my existence that is on my family and my heart. I don't want to take any pain drugs - at all.

2. I was on 75mgs q 48 hrs. for SPONDYLOSIS,DDD, 
SCIATICA, SCOLOSIS, OSTEOPENIA, AND OSTEOARTHRITIS.   I was switched to 90 mgs everyday. 
4. Closely monitored an did all procedures but 1, the stim as tens unit was never any help.
5. Had to do procedures in order to get meds.
6. Sadly, due to ""suggestions"" I was cut way back to 30mgs a day and had an increase in level of pain. I was told I had to wait 1 yr. to see if these expensive ""cures"" worked.
7. Moved to new state an no MD will RX pain meds, only expensive procedures that after 2-3 trials, have NEVER WORKED.
8. I was NEVER AN ADDICT, NOR ADDICTED PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO MY PAIN MEDS.
9. I suffered acute, severe and cruel withdrawal as my BODY, NOT MY MIND, relied on these opioids not only to control my pain, but also chronic diarrehea resulting from SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME (8 ft of small bowel removed). I was in hospital for 2 months while my GI surgeon an doctor tried to find the right combination of meds. He finally settled on codeine 30 mgs qid an lomotil tid. 
10. Well, guess what...no pain meds, nor codeine.
11. Now in misery, with no QUALITY of life. I have a profoundly disabled adult daughter, pets, a home an a spouse also disabled that I can NOT care for properly.
12. I needed my pain meds and GI meds daily so I can care for everything, an do it without frequent interruptions. I can not shopping without giving up food 24 hrs prior to going out.
13. I am unable to have any quality of life due to 7/9 pain level an diarrhea that comes on without warning. It does not accure 1-3 times, but all day.
14. Pain an diarrhea have xaused me to go from 110 lbs down to 92 lbs an dropping. Prior to my reversal of ileostomy I was diagnosed as ""failure to thrive"", which I am sure you know what that means.
15. Many if us, now deprived of either arrived dose to help with pain or cut off completely have either considered suicide or have done so.
The CDC, an Dr. K, have ammended statements that it is not a prescribed opiod crisis but an ILLEGAL DRUGS   AND IMPORTED FENTANYL AN METHAMPHETAMINES.
16.While my pain meds an diarrhea med, codiene have never ever fully controlled either pain or diarrhea they did help keep pain levels at a level where I could function. The codeine really helped to somewhat control diarrhea.
Without my much needed meds; I was on pain meds for over 20 plus years an although it NEVER got rid of my pain, it allowed me the ability to take care of what I needed to take care of daily. None of us are ever pain free, but can function an have some quality of life. My meds, both of them daily helped me somewhat control my diarrhea so that I could do daily chores, go shopping, or go exploring historic Virginia or take day trips with my other daughter.
Now, without anything to help my body both pain an diarrhea are somewhat damped down.
The constant pain an misery 24/7 have caused me to lose weight, lose sleep, lose quality of life. I was disabled an in SSI prior to 62 years if age when Michigan made me take early retirement, so I will never get FULL RETIREMENT. My oldest daughter recieves medicare through her father as she has an IQ of a 9 month old and has cerebral palsy as well. Our combined payments put us so far below poverty. Akso until the CDC completely reverses and pushes back these sugfestions what pain control, what diarrhea control will NEVER EXSIST FOR US. I live in a state without Medicaid expansion so output financially is just more additional punishment an hurdles I can not over come. I am slowly dying because of limits imposed an doctor fear of the DEA. I have none of the meds I need to live and to continue to live, nor does my daughter. Most chronic pain patients are over these imposed limits. These limits are not adequate for most of us. We were an can be maintained on the limits found to work best for us. One size, cookie cutter medicine is not effective, is cruel an unusual punishment. It does not protect doctor/patient relationships. You can not prescribe limits when you have not seen patient one or talked to patient one. Our doctors need to practise the art of medicine, they are trained by further education. These illogical limits serve no one. Your KILLING more people than helping. Pain control as far as opioids have no limits. My other medication was a direct result of trial an error to find what works best for me.

A patient diagnosed with such a condition might begin treatment with opioids in his/her twenties. With a qualified pain specialist, an appropriate narcotics agreement, and no evidence of misuse (based on regular urine tests) there is no reason to assume these patients couldn't continue this needed therapy indefinitely. These patients are able to work, function, raise children, and participate in society, thanks to appropriate use of these medications.

What happens when these patients reach Medicare age? 

If Medicare limits dosage to 90 MME/day, the appropriate long-term treatment these patients depend on is threatened. It is unconscionable government overreach to prevent patients from obtaining medication prescribed lawfully and appropriately by a pain specialist, especially for patients with a 40+ year history of good functionality and no signs of abuse.

Capping dosage to 90 MME is inappropriate for many pain patients, as evidenced by their twenty years (or more) of successful life on a dosage higher than that.

There is a big difference between patients, like myself, who are only able to find relief in opioid therapy and street users looking for some kind of high. I find just relief in my medication. No high.

I have also lost both knee joints in 19 lesions, where I am walking bone-on-bone. This happened because of the dysfunction of my spine, and now I need two full knee replacements.  

There's NO CHANCE in the world that I would trust any medical professional to manage acute post-surgical pain now. I have lost all confidence in the medical profession. I find it appalling that CMS is choosing to force American citizens back to the worst and poorest standard of pain care, something akin to Russian or Indian methods, which are ....virtually nothing. The Russians drink themselves to death and ask to be buried in snow to die. Why? Because Only 7% have any access to pain relief. THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING. But CMS wants to pharma and clerks to for tap3r so many.  WHY? 

I would never have a serious elective surgery in the US because I have no confidence that my post sx pain would be adequately managed. Thousands of other patients are choosing not to use medical services because of the lack of adequate pain relief. When are you going to realize that these policies are going to cost physicians and hospitals a tremendous amount of money? And Dr.'s can't do interventional procedures on people on a monthly basis, like they could medical management patients. So where are docs going to make up for the lack of income lost to arbitrary CMS policies? CMS is ripping away all the authority docs worked and saved for for years to attain, only to give in to bean counters?

I am a Medicare patient because I am retired. I rely upon opioid medications to manage the unrelenting pain of my injuries. No other class of medications manage this pain and provide the smallest amount of amount of side effects. I have tried them all. And I've tried all the ""holistic/complementary/folksy"" remedies. Guess what, people, THEY DONT WORK! I spent 40,000 on a ""multi-displinary center""...and it was staffed by kinesiology interns from the community college. Total waste of money as we ""slid""  on our knees to the commode and back!   

I have the right to access prescriptions in whatever amount my physician and I decide to try. It's none of the pharmacy's  business what my doctor and I have decided to use. Pharmacies are there to to fill Rx's, NOT be deputized into a witch hunt for villains you'll never find in doctor' offices, as the criminals DONT sign up to be monitored by the PDMP, pissing out urine for it's magical bank-account-healing properties, and being dehumanized, disbelieved, and treated as criminals.

When are our doctors going to stand up and take back the dignity of their Profession?  Insurers would NOT get away with this if y'all weren't so passive and scared. STICK UP FOR YOUR PATIENTS! Like me, they may need opioid pain medications to allow them to function in various jobs like mine.

If CMS were to institute hard dose caps, I could be forced into immediate withdrawal situations that could kill me. I will have a  cardiovascular event with sudden loss of opioids. It terrifies me to think that this could happen to me anytime...because - through some arbitrary decision made by a bureaucrat in an insurerer company  - I was denied my needed meds, and then I had a stroke. Only my physician and I should have the right to determine what pharmaceutical is best for me and at what dose, and for how long, and for what purpose. And no one else should have an Opinion. Not CMS, not Walgreens, not an insurer. 

I know that addiction brings steep drains to state and federal budgets. Maybe it seems like getting rid of chronic pain patients won't cost much. But has CMS considered the thus-far uncounted costs involved of these opioid-limiting policies? What about people who can't work? They will have to go on disability. If they're on disability, they'll have to go on Medicare. Once they're on Medicare, they'll have expensive interventional procedures to relieve pain, such as implanted pumps and devices, which will ALL have to be paid for by the government. 

You'll also force most treating, caring physicians out of practice, thus backlogging the system into a tremendously long waiting list to see a PM. If that were to happen, the burden on our emergency rooms would be immense. CMS would also create a situation where suicide might seem like a better option, and that carries expensive toxicology panels and more coroners. 

I urge CMS, with every fiber of my being, to reject the temptation to draw an arbitrary dose limit or day limit. Let physicians do their jobs. Trust in their training. 

Oh and MME is junk science, and no one should EVER rely upon it.  The CDC guidelines were the worst science masquerading as fact that was ever foisted on the American people. 

Why not go after the illicit, non-medicinal, contaminated heroin, meth, and fentanyl dealers? WE ALL KNOW THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE DYING THESE GRUESOME DEATHS!  It's not patients, it's illegal drug users!

I am a chronic pain patient with Adhesive Arachnoiditis, Cauda Equina Syndrome,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, and Chronic Pain Syndrome. AA is a debilitating disease of the spinal cord that causes chronic neuroinflamation of the arachnoid layer, is progressive as nerves become surrounded by scar tissue preventing them from functioning properly, is incurable, and causes severe, intractable, centralized pain. 

I rely on opioids to give me relief from pain and to have any kind of quality of life. Without these life saving medications I would be bedbound I agony. I required assitance to go the bathroom, personal grooming caused too much pain, it kept me from sleeping for more than a few hours at a time. 

My physician worked diligently to find the right combination of  medications. A swab test to determined how I metabolize medications determined that I require a higher dose than the CDC Guidelines state. My treatment plan also requires benzodiazepines and Gabapentin for nerve pain and to aid in sleeping. 

The CDC Guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, none are board certified in pain management, and some who may have professionally and personally profited from the outcome. The guidelines does not consider genetic differences or variations in patient size. Pain is a complex issue, it cannot be seen as a one size fits all.

 Dr. Charles V. Burton, world renowed expert in the area of spinal care and complex spinal problems explains in his publication, ""The Burton Report,"" ""This Chemical Meningitis is more specifically called Adhesive Arachnoiditis or to be technically correct in the cases of those caused by ""chemicals"", Chemically Induced Adhesive Arachnoiditis.""  Dr. Burton goes on to say, ""Unlike bacterial or fungal meningitis, which can lead to death, Chemical Meningitis rarely produces death but often results in totally disabling life-long chronic pain. Those that suffer with this form of Adhesive Arachnoiditis, it is the most excruciating, debilitating pain that tops the pain charts, along with Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome, and is beyond imaginable.""

 My quality of life has improved dramticatcally in the five years I have taken these medications. I can cook meals for my family, do simple tasks around my home, go camping with my husband and grandson. Things I love to do are possibly again. 

I take my medications responsibly and as directed. I do not share or sell them, I keep them locked up in a fire safe. I am a complaint, model patient. Due to no fault of my own, I have a life altering illness that requires the use of opioids for any quality of life. 

 I do not get high, only relief from pain and improvement in function. The chronic pain patient does not experience the euphoria as does an addict. The difference is that our receptors are full of pain signals, thus the high does not happen. The CDC states that 95% of pain patients do NOT become addicted to pain medications. 

It is not the chronic pain community that is causing the opioid crisis, it is illicit fentanyl and heroin causing the overdose rates to climb. In 2010 the surge in heroin related deaths coincided with the reformulation of Ocycotin and the proliferation of fentanyl fortified heroin. An addict will find whatever is available to get that high they seek to escape life. I take legally prescribed opioids to do exactly the opposite, I want to participate in life. 

If Medicare adopts the recommended dosage as the standard of care, my life as I know it will end. I will not seek out street drugs because I am a law abiding citizen.  I will not take the chance of dying to relieve pain. I will be exactly where I was in excruciating agony for the rest of my days. 
Medicare will have effectively signed my death sentence.  

Medicare reimbursement schedule paid for an Epidural Steroid Injection that is the cause AA. Corticosteroids used in ESI's are NOT FDA approved for use in the epidural space. They are intended for intramuscular use only. Each vial states, ""NOT FOR EPIDURAL ADMINISTRATION."" Arachnoiditis is listed as an adverse effect on the data sheets. Although physicians are allowed to use as off label, often without proper informed consent, ESI's are causing harm on a grand scale. Patients are  abandoned after they are harmed, disabled with a lifelong, devasting, chronic illness. An estimated nine million  procedures are done yearly. The FDA announced the safety and effectiveness has never been established. Think of the harm reduction, and the savings to Medicare if it were to stop paying for ESI.

A legacy clause for pain patients who are on stable doses of opioids should be implemented. Opioids help us tolerate our diseases, they are the closest thing pain patients have that offer the potential few hours of rest from pain.

Thank you the open comment period, I hope the voice of the millions of chronic pain is taken seriously. This is a life or death matter. Please help us by choosing life.

That is what this really comes down to it personal choices and personal accountability for those choices.

I am tired of be treated like a criminal by society because I depend on pain medication so I can go to work like so many other people do each day. This practice of restricting or eliminating access to pain medication in an effort to curb addiction and overdose is absurd and needs to STOP NOW. We live in a democracy where it is supposed to be the majority rules not the minority. Last time I checked chronic pain patients outnumbered the addicts and yet somehow we are ignored by politicians and community groups and each new law that further restricts our access to the medications we use to try and lead somewhat of a normal life is just another nail in our coffin. We did not ask for this, we did not choose to lead this kind of life unlike the addicts you are trying to protect from themselves. I am begging you for once do the right thing and stop passing more laws that do little to help addicts and cause great harm to chronic pain patients who had no choice in our fate. For once help those who are truly in need of mercy and understanding from a healthcare system that failed us and a government that is continually punishing us for something we had no choice in. We do not need more restrictions on medication what we do need are more pain management doctors who can focus on monitoring patients on pain medications to ensure they are used properly and can watch for the signs of addiction before it goes too far. Like every other trade out there in medicine pain management is a specialized field and by having dedicated doctors it will be easier to monitor and control even the doctors who would abuse the system for financial gain.

Greetings -

I am writing you on the proposed Medicare prescription rules for opioids & pain management.   I have been living with extreme pain for almost 5 years now due to 4 major back fusion surgeries, have spinal stenosis, have severe Arthritis, have an unstable SI JT & have an Immune Deficiency Disease (CVID).   I currently seeing  a pain management Dr every month for the horrific daily pain that I suffer from.  Many days throughout the month my pain levels shoot up to 9/10 just trying to do simple/basic household chores in moderation.  I am on an extended relief pain med and along w hydrocodone.  I have always been a model pain RX pill consumer as well, to the point of not taking them as much on my good days.   I have had to quit work & go on SSD three years ago due to being unable to sit upright in a chair for over 20 mins at a time or walk any long distances.   I am praying that you consider my situation and others when proposing caps of 90 pills & prescriptions for only 7 days at a time for patients like myself on Medicare as we are not abusers of the medications, but rely on them every day for some sort of normalcy & lower pain levels in our lives.  I do not abuse prescription drugs, nor have I ever had any addictive tendencies.  Please consider my story when voting on and making up new laws/rules.   Thank you for taking the time to hear my voice and pleas.

"407","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I fail to understand how blanket restrictions on opioids for chronic pain patients can possibly have a positive effect on the opioid ""crisis"" in America today. When we consider the false narrative promoted by bureaucrats, politicians, and law enforcement that pain patients and our physicians are at the source of this so-called ""crisis,"" but the truth of the matter is problematic substance use among pain patients is minimal. Studies show it is between 7 and 10%. While that number is significant, it is not enough to spark a crisis. Setting limits can only have a negative effect on patients AND our physicians. Only my doctor can know my medical history, my pain levels, and the treatments that have and have not worked to manage that pain over the past eighteen years I've been a chronic pain patient. 

The real problem here is not pain patients. It is the war on drugs. Until that is realized and accepted in government circles and acted upon by abandoning the stupidity that is this ""war,"" nothing positive is going to happen with the opioid crisis. Criminalizing people who need help is not an answer. Prohibition is not an answer. Neither is an effective strategy if the goal is saving lives and helping those who want to stop, stop. There are no perfect, zero use solutions. To believe there are is ludicrous fantasy. Why do we not implement Harm Reduction instead? 

I am becoming very angry with a government that believes practicing medicine without a license, and treating every patient with the same standard is effective in any way, shape or form. When one applies common sense, this is easily seen. I am old, and I am tired. I am also tired of being told by my government what I can and cannot do to relieve pain I cannot eliminate. MY GOVERNMENT DOES NOT KNOW ANY PATIENT'S CONDITION! HOW CAN IT KNOW WHAT IS OR IS NOT BEST TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS' CONDITIONS WITH A SINGLE STANDARD AND A SINGLE UPPER LIMIT? CANCER IS NOT THE ONLY CONDITION THAT CAUSES INTRACTABLE PAIN. I am sorry. I am done. If I must defy my government in order to have sensible treatment, that is what I will do. Because that is what you will make necessary if you enact these stupid limits. I have reached my limits, both physically and mentally. I am an intelligent adult who is capable of working in cooperation with my medical team to decide what is or is not best for my treatment, and I will not allow government interference to make my conditions worse!

"409","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I join those concerned that CMS is stepping into the role of physician by seeking to impose limits on prescribing opiate medication. People who suffer from chronic intractable pain find relief from medication that others may abuse. Restricting the ability of a doctor to alleviate suffering regardless of the source of the suffering takes away part of the ability of a doctor to practice medicine. CMS is not qualified to practice medicine! Furthermore, the scourge of addiction is driving the deaths from opioids and the deaths from prescribed opiate medication has been and is going down. The deaths from opioids, not prescription medication, are going up due to street drugs and addiction. Also, the CDC statistics indicate that the age group 65 and over has remained fairly flat over time. Those on Medicare through disability would probably be in different age groups but it is impossible to tell the rates of addiction from CDC statistics.  The problem that is attempting to be addressed by these regulations is not one of supply of prescriptions; the CMS is not qualified to practice medicine and that is what goes on in deciding which patient requires what dosage of what medicine. The problem is addiction - provide funding for that! 
In addition, the numbers from the CDC state themselves that deaths may be counted more than once since people often have more than one type of opioid in their system at the time of death. Because of this, they are counted in more than one category. This leads me to believe that the ""number of deaths"" is inflated. It is impossible to know if they are going up or down due to this anomaly. Not that dying from addiction is acceptable!
In the state of Oregon the number of deaths from opioids has gone down from 2012 to 2016; the total number of deaths are about (Oregon Health Authority) 250 in 2016. Per the CDC, slightly over 500.

Even my Neurologist does not believe that more surgery is advisable at this time and I do NOT want more surgery. I have been sent to a spine doctor who is treating me with injections and Tramadol. He also recommends Acupuncture which MEDICARE does NOT approve and I cannot afford. The injections help but I still need 2 Tramadol a day. Because my doctor is afraid of losing her license, I have to now ""fight for"" getting the prescription for Tramadol. I am not an addict and am very careful with my medications but the CDC Guidelines which were NOT written by pain management physicians have made it so difficult for patients to get medication that I no longer feel that I live in a free country. Now if Medicare adds requirements to approving medications, I feel like even more hopelessness  will set in. This will force more risk of suicide, strikes, and cardiac issues. I live in Senior Housing where many individuals cannot get out of bed without pain medication. Please do not take away what life Seniors have left by making it more difficult to get needed medication. If Medicare does not approve my medications, I cannot afford them. You will just be giving more power to the insurance companies who do not have the knowledge and training to understand pain management. This needs to be left to the doctors
who understand complex pain and treat the patient so that they are able to function and ""have a life"". I live with people who are in worse shape than me. I don't want to be an invalid. The harder Medicare makes getting medication for us, the more you are encouraging Disability, Assisted Living, Need for Care by Aides, and Social Services for Seniors.

You see my doctor has already stopped my oral medication that supplemented my implanted pain pump. Pain pumps are great but I cannot be given a therapeutic dosage because of sedation. This sedation causes me to sleep 17 hours a day on average. So the pump has to be turned down for this reason. However with turning it down the pain increases. At one time I had oral pain medication prescribed to counter this problem. About two years ago my doctor just cut me off of the oral meds. Since that time I have not had a life. I can only do the basic things to survive. Like eat a cold hot dog because I cannot stand in the kitchen long enough to prepare a decent meal. I cannot even shop for a decent meal. With these proposed changes that make the 90 MME a requirement would be devastating for a lot of folks who require a higher dosage.

"417","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"The current ""Opioid Crisis"" is due in part to a lack of understanding of what actually causes intractable unbearable pain. The discovery of the microglial cells and their effects on what is now being termed ""neuroinflammation"", has changed things. The latest treatment protocols, both revolutionary and evolutionary have been developed due to an international search for a ""better"" answer than merely attempting to alleviate pain without killing the patient by opioid overdose or through the slow accumulation of toxic effects over time from some accepted pain relievers such as acetaminophen, a.k.a Tylenol or other NSAIDs. Had I been on high dose NSAIDs all those 27 years, I would most likely be facing dialysis treatments for renal failure. Instead, my high dose opioid regimen has preserved my life.

These exciting newer protocols promote the use of older, much less expensive medications such as ketorolac, ketamine, oxytocin, clonidine, anti-seizure agents, stimulants, antidepressants, and select corticoids before ""stepping up to"" opioids to relieve the neuroinflammatory process that is primarily to blame for causing unceasing horrific pain. By using these new treatment protocols in clinical practice, we may now be able to stop the creation of new high-dose opioid patients like me and the other 500,000 to 1 million other legacy patients from the years when these treatments, just mentioned, were unknown as successful treatments that are curative of the underlying cause of most intractable pain.

Many people like me, 1.6 million, are taking more than the 90 MEQ a day for their pain due to identifiable genetic factors that we now know can cause malabsorption of opiates, i.e. the standard dose expected to relieve our pain doesn't work because our bodies don't process opioids as well as ""normal"" folks. Kind of like diabetics who need insulin because their bodies can't process sugars properly. 
Using an arbitrary dose ceiling of 90-120 MEQ is dangerous to legacy patients like me who did not have the opportunity to be treated at the initial time of their injury or disease under an ""opiate sparing"" treatment paradigm like the ones I have mentioned above.  Should I be facing withdrawal, death, and the destruction of a fruitful life because others abuse their prescriptions?  Or get drugs on the street?  This is cruel and unusual punishment.  Flagging patients because of potential issues with total dose ceilings above 200MEQ is one thing.  Denying them the care they need is another.

  Arachnoiditis is an unbearable burning pain front and back from the waist down that increases with every step (or shuffle) I take..  It is a mind boggling,constant, screaming pain and of course there is no cure; The only treatment available for it is to relieve some of the pain.
My lupus and sjogrens is also very painful-each in their own special little way to add joint pain, eye pain and migraines to the mix.  I currently take a chemotherapy drug for the auto=immunes severity.
Scolosis, connective tissue disease, and degenerative disc disease all hurt in seperate places too.
When I had good corporate insurance I had my diseases under control because they allowed and paid for the medications I needed and was happily employed for years and even bought my own business.  with the new business came new insurance that would not allow many of the medications I was takeing and I became unable to work. 
I am in the process of getting my social security disability that would not have been necessary had I still had access to my medication.

I have severe pain and percocets cannot touch it but I do not want to give up the only hope I have of gettig out of bed for a few hours each day.

The chemo drug (but I don;t have cancer) has a affinity for giving patients lymphoma and right now, that is my hope because everyone is saying that people with cancer can have pain medication and it is cruel not to give it to them.  The arachnoiditis expert Dr Burton says it is ""the pain of stage 4 cancer without the relief of death""----here is hoping for bad chemo side effects so I can get rid or lessen this pain.

"423","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am asking again this year, as a disabled part D plan beneficiary and Chronic Pain Patient of 20 years, to not codify limits based on the CDC's extremely flawed (although well intentioned) opioid guidelines. When the foundation is so deeply flawed, all that follows will be flawed. As both a person with degrees in Addiction Studies and Social Work and as a 20 yr Cancer Survivor, who relies on Ultra High Dose pain medication, I do understand the social ill that your agency feels tasked to address, but view these limits as shortsighted, wrongheaded, and harmful to the pain community and the precious few providers, who are still willing to treat us. The CDC didn't set out to limit or deny access to medications for legitimate pain patients, but that is exactly whats happened, whether it was the intended consequence or not. Any further actions taken, will only serve to limit access even more to those who really need the medication. More Physicians will leave pain care due to the additional burdens placed on them by spending time trying to justify medical necessity to part D sponsors. Pharmacists will also find it easier to just deny fills or not stock certain medications (which is the case at my local CVS) and continue to use highly discriminatory practices against already vulnerable disabled pain patients. We are treated very poorly and in a way that no one would want a loved one treated. These limits and hard edits at POS also put completely undue additional burdens on pain patients, who often struggle to make it to monthly appointments due to both disability and often distance they are forced to travel to obtain pain care. Denying a fill, allowing 7 days supply while a coverage determination is obtained and asking them to return for another prescription, is just too much to ask of the population that Medicare/Medicaid serves. We are being hit from every angle at the pain clinic, at the pharmacy, by our insurers and we are not the problem and therefore actions taken to limit or deny access to the pain community, will not be the solution. We are really suffering due to forced cuts on legacy patients who have been medically stable at doses far above what the CDC suggests and what CMS is proposing. CPPs and our veterans are taking their lives at 3 times the rate of the general public without pain medication at therapeutic doses. Legacy patients are on higher doses due to tolerance and worsening of progressive conditions but are being subjected to cruel forced dose cuts, to try to make them fit into a one size fits all model of pain care. This has never been true for pain care, as all pain and all patients and their response are unique. Instead of trying to implement more bad policy, based on bad policy, it would be of more benefit to the population you serve to protect pain patients and the doctors who serve them. These limits and barbaric cuts are so very detrimental to our health and well being. We are disabled and suffering discriminatory practices subbourned by our own government and those who are charged with protecting and treating us are capitulating to extremely biased anti opiate groups like PROP. Please help us by refusing to place even more restrictions, causing more undue burden and denying access to effective evidence based affordable pain care. Help legitimate patients and care givers swing the pendulum back to a midpoint, where we are allowed some quality of life. In a climate where even cancer patients and survivors are being denied access, something has gone awry. We need a government agency to push back and protect us, not simply document and track complaints of patients denied and suffering. It will cost more to not properly address pain. There will be more loss of productivity, more disability cost. and more patients pushed by restrictive policies to suicide and illicit drug use, which is exactly why this is shortsighted and wrongheaded, if the goal is to lessen the number of lives lost to the heroin epidemic. Many have warned that this could be the consequence. The CDC has already said that as prescriptions go down, the death toll continues to rise. When will CMS policy reflect this, instead of blaming and punishing patients and providers? Please, I beg you to reconsider the harm to us verses risk. Its not us overdosing, diverting medications, or committing crimes. We just want to participate in life as best as we can. We don't expect to be pain free, but we don't expect the government to deny access to therapeutic doses of medications our doctors deem necessary to keep us stable or force us to endure painful withdrawal and medical crisis. Please stand with us and demand the CDC rewrites the guidelines to include chronic noncancer pain and leave our pain care to the pain specialists. Thank you for your time and consideration of concerns of the 1.6 million who would be harmed if these limits where mandated and the 98.4 million, who would be hurt when private insurers follow suit.

Let's examine the recent studies and facts associated. I urge you to review these, as they are vastly different than the facts and figures being touted by the mainstream media and even some policymakers:

#1. ""Less than 4 percent of people who had misused prescription pain medicines started using heroin within 5 years""
Source: https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin

#2. Long gone is the notion that 80% of heroin users start with pain medication. ""Heroin as an initiating opioid now exceeds hydrocodone and oxycodone.""
Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460317302083

#3. Current post-operative pain management carries a risk of addiction of 0.6% (less than one percent)
Source: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180117185105.htm

#4. In counties where coroners have identified the specific drug that caused overdoses, they have found that prescription pain medications are rarely the cause of death
Source 4a: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6634a3.htm (Montgomery County, OH)
Source 4b: https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/11/19/fentanyl-heroin-changing-us-opioid-epidemic (Jefferson County, AL)

The bottom line is this: If someone is going to abuse drugs, they will rarely go to a doctor to do it.  They are going to the streets, purchasing illicit substances. Addicts are not going to be impacted one iota by more restrictions on prescription pain medication.  It isn't helping them, nor is it harming them.  The only people being impacted by these restrictions are the millions of chronic pain patients who are being harmed by these restrictions. Are some patients abusing medications? Yes, but studies show that it is less than one percent. Why punish more than 99% of us for the actions of less than 1%?

Restrictions on pain medications are doing absolutely nothing to help the opiate epidemic.  Quite the opposite, in fact. Patients who lose access to the one treatment that help them are turning to the streets, buying illicit medication in an attempt to end their suffering.  If you review the statistics attached (source: ATIP), you will see that a decrease in pain prescriptions occurs at the same time that overdoses skyrocket. Why would you want to continue this trend????

Please, stop the discrimination against pain patients. We have done absolutely nothing wrong. If there is one thing I can stress, it's that doctors are refusing to treat us because they are afraid of being unjustly prosecuted by the DEA. CMS implementing further restrictions on pain medication will do nothing to help addiction and only further the inhumane suffering of pain patients.

I will be eligible for Medicare due to disability later this year.  I am also an intractible pain patient; my pain is 24/7, 365 days a year due to adhesive arachnoiditis (AA).  The pain produced by adhesive arachnoiditis has been compared to that of end stage cancer, but without the escape of death. PLEASE, think about that for a moment.  What would you do if you had the pain of end stage bone cancer, and knew you would have to live with that pain for the next 30-40 years. Unable to leave home, rarely leaving your bed. Please, tell me what lengths you would go to relieve that pain? Now, what if you found something that let you function again, go to see your children perform, go to the grocery store, and even take a vacation for the first time in years.  Would you be upset if the government were trying to take that away? You bet you would!  And so am I extremely frustrated by the lack of concern for the chronic pain community when these regulations are proposed. 

Untreated and under-treated pain can, and do, kill.  By limiting the amount of pain medication a doctor can prescribe, will you be able to sleep at night knowing that thousands of pain patients are committing suicide, going into adrenal crisis, or having heart attacks because of their pain?  Will you be able to sleep knowing that millions of post-op patients will need to make unnecessary trips back to their surgeon for another prescription because the government wouldn't allow them more than a 7 day supply for their pain?  These proposals are absolutely preposterous!

"434","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been a chronic pain patient since 2007.  In 2008 I needed urgent surgery to stabilize my neck so I did not become paralyzed.  I had a fusion from c3-7 and while the problems were corrected, I now suffer from Failed Neck Surgery Syndrome.  This causes me horrific headaches on a daily basis.  Because the headaches are not migraines, the use of opioid medication has allowed me a better quality of life.  Since the surgery the level above now has bad arthritis at the facet joints which has increased my pain greatly.  My doctor and I decided to increase my dosage and type of medication so that I could work part time, due small household tasks at my home, feed my birds and do light gardening, and volunteer work.  

If this proposed change to Medicare goes into effect, I will no longer be able to function to do all the things listed above.  My headaches will intensify and cause me to again retreat for days to a darkened room, with ice packs to dull the pain for a short amount of time.  I will no longer be as self sufficient and will rely on help for many household tasks, and all work and volunteer work will end as I will constantly be at a level 6-8 pain.  

Please do not hurt chronic pain patients like me who have been productive citizens because we have been on stronger doses of pain medications for years. Our quality of life will severely drop and we will become useless to our families and society.  At that point we will become a drain on society.

	Enhancing the OMS by such that it identifies high risk beneficiaries who use ""potentiator"" drugs (such as gabapentin and pregabalin) in combination with prescription opioids to ensure that plans provide appropriate case management. Potentiators are drugs that when taken with an opioid increase the risk of an adverse event.

OMS already flags concurrent benzodiazepine use by plan enrollees. 

This is concerning as the gabapentinoid class of medications are extremely useful for pain management, including pain other than neuropathic with not nearly as much concern in combination with opioids as benzos/z drugs/soma. This is a cornerstone medication that has allowed many providers to reduce opioid use and has sufficient evidence to support its continued use. I would remove the concern for these medications at this time, as there are not very many options for alternatives to opioids for pain management, but rather add soma and z drugs to the list of concerns with opioid medications and the already listed benzodiazepines.


	Implementing technical revisions to the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) measures used by CMS to evaluate Part D sponsors' progress in combatting the opioid crisis, and consideration of a new PQA measure, Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines. Given the danger of combining opioids and benzodiazepines, we seek feedback in the Call Letter on starting to track a new measure to address this issue. This measure assesses the percentage of individuals 18 years and older with concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines.

Again, I would add soma and z drugs to this list; this has also been outlined in the CDC guidelines as medications of concern when used in combination with opioids.


	Expecting all sponsors to implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME), with a 7-day supply allowance.

Is this for acute pain or chronic pain or both? If for chronic pain-the 7 day supply, this is not feasible. If for acute pain-these are reasonable measures, however would take into consideration patients with acute on chronic pain that may end up on >90MED more than their baseline due to a new injury/surgery/trauma/etc.


	Implementing a supply limit for initial fills of prescription opioids (e.g., 7 days) for the treatment of acute pain with or without a daily dose maximum (e.g., 50 MME).

Avoid using a daily dose maximum, however the 7 day supply is in alignment with many guidelines and with the direction of new upcoming guidelines.


	Expecting all sponsors to implement soft POS safety edits (which can be overridden by a pharmacist) based on duplicative therapy of multiple long-acting opioids, and request feedback on concurrent prescription opioid and benzodiazepine soft edits.

Add soma and z drugs to the list. Also consider adding multiple short acting opioid medications to this list.

"443","CMS",FALSE,4,NA,NA,"The proposed changes to Part D regarding opioid prescribing is not only discriminatory on the chronically ill, chronic pain patients and the disabled community due to its undue burdens placed upon them to receive adequate access to the medically necessary pain management medications including opioid analgesics and Gabapentin. These individuals often lack the financial ability to pay for their doctors appointments therefore it is unreasonable both financially to expect individuals suffering from painful illnesses and/or conditions to be able to go to the doctor once a week. Further our physician offices and hospitals do not have the capacity to take on such a large increase in patient load. In addition, the hard and soft edits intended for Medicare and Medicaid recipients are based on policy and not patient-centered; evidence-based medical care that ensures the best approach to treatment is provided to each patient on an individualized basis which can only be determined by our qualified medical doctors. In addition, there is no scientific study nor clinical trial substantiating the CDC Guidelines of 90 Milligram Morphine Equivalents as recommended and being taken up as policy at CMS for FY19. The aging of our population, increased chronic illness, disease and disabilities within the community are all factors into why it is vital our doctors maintain their ability to prescribe as they see appropriate for their patients. The outlined proposal for 2019 is an unworkable plan with undue burdens placed on the disabled, the physicians, regulatory boards and hospitals and further it insights discrimination in our medical care against those among us whom are the weakest. In addition, as a chronic illness patient suffering a debilitating medical condition I find it abhorrent that such policies would be considered given the clear obstacles for any individuals suffering from an illness or painful condition to be able to adhere to so many appointments both financially and physically. In addition, it exposes many ill patients to environmental factors that could be further detrimental to their health and well being. Finally, I advised you to kindly refer to FDA Docket # FDA-2017-P-5396-0001 in which a Citizens Petition is requesting to remove high dose opioid analgesics from the market and is currently under review due to extension review being required. Given this I feel we need to also put this measure on hold and allow for further public comment and impact studies on current measures taken to combat the opioid epidemic before implementing hard line policies that will impact the sickest, poorest American citizens. We must protect the chronic illness, chronic pain and disabled community while we work to protect those suffering from substance use disorder Finally, please find enclosed 128 letters our Organization, Chronic Illness Advocacy & Awareness Group, collected on behalf of our members, my personal letter and my mother's letter for your consideration when making such decision. These are the stories of real individuals these decisions will directly impact through these proposed changes for 2019.

They appear to take away the ability of a doctor to treat his/her patient and give control to the insurance companies. They appear to be based on one report from the CDC that is contradicted by another report from the same agency (report is attached).  All these new regulations will do is force chronic pain sufferers to go to other sources to find relief. It may also increase suicide rates and increase other health problems not to mention increasing ER visits.

I'm not currently taking any opiodes but do take gabapentin. In the future I may need to take both. That combination appears to be red flag. I don't take meds for pain, but for other conditions that appear to be ignored by the proposed regulations.  I know enough chronic pain patients that are quite concerned.

Medicine should be practiced by licensed doctors with a personal connection to a patient and not by insurance companies and politicians.

"447","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm a chronic pain patient, a type 1 diabetic for 50 years with severe arthritis in my spine (and every other joint). In the last ten years, I've had at least one surgery (and sometimes 2) each year due to the damage my disease has done to my body. I have a high tolerance for pain but time has defeated even my strength to function without pain meds. The opiates that I take allow me to be somewhat active and participate in social and family activities. I'm responsible about my meds. I take them as prescribed and I never let them be available to others. I've never experienced euphoria, and I've never craved these pain meds as I've heard addicts describe their reactions to them. While I would wish that I could do without pain medications, I learned from trying one of the so-called alternative pain management programs for a year that my quality of life would be very poor without my medications. 
The restrictions already in place have made it difficult to get these medications even with a legitimate prescription. I understand the concern regarding abuse of opiates, but I think the government has already done what is reasonable and then some regarding legally prescribed opiates. Any further restrictions will cause more harm than good. And, as recent studies in the US and the UK have shown, less than 1% of postoperative opiate prescriptions result in opiate misuse. These studies indicate that recent restrictions have nearly eliminated the misuse of opiate prescriptions. Or, it is possible that crackdowns using existing regulations has resulted in the desired effect of making legally prescribed opiates as the root cause of the increase in opiate overdoses. Further restrictions will only serve to increase suffering as in many states, like Florida, people are being left to suffer from unnecessary amounts of postoperative pain. In addition, the restrictions like those in Florida have had the unintended result of leaving people with terminal conditions suffering needlessly and that is just barbaric. I had several Florida doctors tell me that they felt my meds were necessary for my quality of life, but they couldn't prescribe these meds without the DEA digging thru all their patient records, shutting down their practice while the records were reviewed. It's not right that all patients and doctors be forced to pay such a heavy price for the actions of a few bad apples, and that's where we are. 
Another unintended consequence of the existing restrictions is that a bunch of ""pain management"" clinics have opened up using the programs originally designed as addiction programs. These programs may help people with addiction problems but are doing a great disservice to people with real, severe chronic pain problems as these people aren't helped (much) by being treated as drug addicts. It adds a whole new level of stress to people already in great distress.  
I think it's important to consider that the existing restrictions have already drastically reduced the number of opiate prescriptions being written. However, the number of opiate overdoses continues to go up. Illegal opiates are flooding the US from China and Mexico, just to name a few of the countries from which such drugs are being smuggled. In December, in my home state of Nebraska, police captured several pounds of illegal powdered fentanyl. It wasn't from prescribed fentanyl - it was from China. Rather than further restricting legal opiates to the point of doing further harm to people like me, it seems that the government should turn its resources to reducing the flow of illegal opiates. 
Thank you, and please stop the swing of the pendulum from being too many prescriptions to not enough - both situations do a great disservice to Americans.

I am a pain patient diagnosed with (spinal stenosis herniated discs osteoarthritis ) for (14) years. I tried( all other so called pain medications ) - all the non-opioids (n-saids,SSRIs, SNRIs, Steroids, anti-epileptics, BEFORE opioids  (i.e., PT, OT, Aqua T, Chiro, Osteo, injections, devices, procedures, CBT/mindfulness, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, TENs, MENS, natural remedies, etc.) but they all failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and (suffering to where I am able to be a functioning supportive member of society able to work be active more with family no depression from the damn pain.._) - improved function that opioids help with working, chores, childcare, travel, entertainment, etc.
If Medicare/Medicaid/private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME/any dosage I will lose your job, income, home, car, entertainment, not be able to care for family/house, etc.
I have been a model, compliant patient,  have a pain contract - random UAs, pill counts, every month and dr visits before anything is written.the Dr's are keeping a very close eye on what and who..there doing a good job .
do not penalize the people  and Dr's for the few criminals who abuse the process and system..
My medications are stored safely and secured as directed by the dr and i use one pharmacy, avoid alcohol, cannabis, etc. it is unlikely my condition will improve and the effects of time and aging will make things worse. Opioids and pain management were a last resort options unfortunately 
Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.
These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.
Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.
I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.
My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.
A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.
A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.
I take Benzos,for anxiety and Gabapentin, Lyrica) safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed. if these medications to be discontinued I do not believe I could any longer be a supporting factor to society due to my illness and pain. No longer be able to provide function at all. I tried for the last 6 months with out any medications and it does not just go away it gets worse. i have never been so sick so unable to move think function it's terrible. I pray you never have to suffer like this. It's horrid. I want to be able to be there for my country my family  my community.

Once doctors stopped prescribing me pain medication, I became a chronic Tylenol user until my liver was almost destroyed. When I was on normal pain meds, this was never an issue.

By using regulation to limit pain management opposed to doctors that are trained to treat pain, it is negligent and and harmful to those that really need it. 
Let doctors do their jobs without fear of the government making up draconian rules that only cause unintended harm like it did to me.
Luckily I finally found a doctor that helped with my chronic pain, but it was only after roughly 10 years of being told nothing could be done. Now I am pain medication free and hardly need to take any Tylenol for anything.

Not everyone that is an addict and most strive to be off the medication. Simply taking away the pain medication is not the way to go, it is a treatment option that is available to help patients until they can either be helped otherwise or to keep some quality of life.

"458","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a former RN, currently on Medicare, receiving treatment for chronic pain. I have several endocrine disorders, several autoimmune disorders, arthritis, migraine headaches, occular MG, Crohn's and heart disease. This started when I was in my 30s and escalated to a point where I could no longer work by my late 40s. At the beginning, I used tylenol and both OTC and prescription strength NSAIDs. Twice I had to be treated for ulcers, and have now been ordered by my GI specialist to stop all NSAIDs. I have gone through months of physical therapy and chiropractics in the past. I currently receive steroid injections into my right shoulder three times every year, and 1-2 in my knee. Medicare limits the number I can have. Due to high blood pressure and a history of one MI that occurred in my 50s, I am not a candidate for shoulder replacement. I receive  epidural injections into my neck and lower back, but these procedures are quite costly and place a financial burden on my family and I. My ability to exercise is limited due to fatigue which dramatically increases when pain levels increase. 
I have done a lot to decrease the pain I experience on a continual basis. The injections only work to decrease pain moderately, and then wear off. I am currently on Effexor for pain reduction and tried gabapentin in the past with marginal results and intolerable side effects. I have previously been on plaquinil, methotrexate and Xeljanz, but unable to tolerate the last two due to side effects.
Currently, I require (if I calculated correctly) 100MME/day in order to be able to move well enough to get out of bed. This is quite a reduction from the highest amount I have been on in my lifetime, of about 250MME/day or so, with the addition of benzodiazepines. Over time, I have been able to decrease the dosage of opiates required for breakthrough pain, as some of the therapies (injections mostly, including epidurals) began helping. I have not needed benzodiazepines for over 2-3 years.
I have been under the care of a pain management specialist for around 12 years. As such, contracts for safe storage and usage, urine drug screens and frequent doctor visits have been the norm. I have been compliant with the usage of medication, and used break-through pain medication only when I had to, resulting in the lower dose I require now. I use only one pharmacy, with changes made only because of in-network insurance changes. Opiod pain medications were used as a last resort. Without the relatively small dose I currently take I can not get from the bed to the bathroom without assistance and considerable pain. At 100MME per day, the dose is small considering I have taken opiods daily for 12 years (and also    sporadically during my lifetime for post-surgical and post-injury pain, and then more often prior to seeing pain management doctor) and yet I still receive a positive response from them.
My condition, although not terminal in the general sense, will never get better. This includes the life-long  and life-threatening disease of adrenal insufficiency which will always be dangerous. This was most likely caused by the prolonged physical and mental stress of daily pain which was constantly at least at moderate intensity from awakening in the morning, until finally falling asleep at night. It's very difficult to adequately explain the amount of pain I have lived with daily, and am nowhere near pain free now.
I am a huge supporter of reducing illicit drug use and the deaths they cause from dirty drugs of unknown content sold by street vendors. What I cannot understand is why the deaths from pain medication, written by a treating physician for a compliant, educated patient, are lumped in with deaths from all narcotics, those obtained illegally and even heroin! How does criminalizing the actions of patients and those in the medical community for legitimate use stop the use and abuse of illicit drugs? It's a completely different demographic that seek drug dealers vs. doctors.
Considering that more patients die each year from the acute and chronic adverse effects and allergies from NSAIDs, it makes no sense limiting legitimate use of monitored opiates which are no more risky than any other medication. Additionally, if patients with chronic pain must face a return to the levels of pain they endured prior to treatment by their doctor, the only person who understands their complex diagnoses and needs, I believe the number of suicides in the US will rise to a number unprecedented in the US. It crosses the mind of chronic pain suffers more often than you might think.
I sincerely hope that this ""war on opiods"" will be concentrated on illicit and illegal use, and the war on chronic pain suffers will finally come to an end. Please, research and reach out to the chronic pain community.

My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare. A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when I am in pain.

"467","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am 61 and will fairly soon be on Medicare. For 15+ years I have suffered with a debilitating back condition, as well as chronic migraines. I was recently diagnosed with a painful bladder condition, interstitial cystitis. When first diagnosed with the back condition, I had great difficulty walking, sitting or standing. I spent much of my time in bed, where I got some degree of relief. 

After trying physical therapy, acupuncture, many non narcotic pain medicines (gabapentin, lyrica, cymbalta, nsaids, etc) and undergoing numerous radio frequency lesioning procedures, massage, Chinese herbal treatments, creams, a TENS unit, chiropractic care, and epidural injections, my pain management doctors decided that oxycodone was the most effective treatment for me. 

I have been on 90 - 120 mgs of oxycodone daily (30 mgs every 6 hours as needed) for many years. I am under a strict contract with my doctor, whom I see monthly. I undergo frequent drug screens and potential pill counts. Over the years the laws have become more and more strict. I used to have a pain management appointment quarterly. Now it is monthly. There is no flexibility allowed by the doctors any more, so any travel or family plans must be carefully scheduled around my doctor appointments. 

In 15+ years of pain management treatment, I have been a model patient. I have never broken the terms of my contract by using more medicine than allowed, ""losing my prescription,"" or ""doctor shopping."" I started a bank auditing company with a partner in 1996 (at the age of 40), developed my back problems, and the medicine allowed me to function enough to work auditing full time in banks for many years. When that became too painful, I worked from home until just a couple of years ago, when I could no longer work and I sold my company. I stopped working at age 60.

The medicine now allows me to have some quality of life. If my private insurers, or soon Medicare, refused to cover the full needed dosage of oxycodone I am currently on, I would be literally curled up in bed for most of my life, in terrible pain. I have tried lowering the dosage, but I don't get enough relief to function even marginally without the full 120 mgs I currently take daily (30 mgs every 6 hours). I have learned that keeping a steady stream of the medicine in my body offers the best pain relief and quality of life. 
 
My doctors have said that my conditions are unlikely to improve; indeed, they are deteriorating. Opioid drugs and pain management were a last resort option for me. Proposed policies limiting prescriptions are not supported by proven studies. These policies could create more chronic pain by not fully treating acute pain, cause more doctors to leave the field of pain treatment, and increase the rate of disability and unemployment claims. Emergency rooms would fill up.  

As mentioned earlier, I am currently 61. My pain medication helps me prevent accidents and falls by helping to control my pain. I believe my medical care and decision making should be left to my own doctor, who is familiar with my medical issues. 

Please allow those of us who have followed the rules, who have a true medical need for the opiods in order to have any quality of life at all, keep the relief that they provide. Thank you.

If your regulation is approved, it will greatly damage my medical care and quality of life. I currently rely upon high dose opioids to manage my intractable and incurable pain by blocking and dampening the pain associated with these horrible conditions. This helps me increase my overall function and remain productive in my activities of daily living. If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid dose per day, this will give private insurance companies an excuse to stop paying for these necessary opioid prescriptions. It will also give pharmacies an excuse to stop dispensing my opioid medications at all.  The proposed policies are completely unsupported by any reliable science. Furthermore, these proposed regulations are based off of guidelines (NOT LAWS) which were recommended by the CDC. These guidelines are completely biased as their recommendations were not inclusive of any data or beliefs from chronic and intractable pain patients nor the pain management specialists who were treating them.  These guidelines were not issued so that any entity associated with the reimbursement of medical services  (i.e.  private prescription insurance providers, Medicare/Medicaid prescription insurance providers, etc) could use them for financial gain.  They were supposedly recommended to decrease the number of opioid overdosages. So if these policies are enacted, they will have several deleterious results:  They will force even more doctors away from treating pain, they will force more patients onto disability, they will create more demand for emergency room service, they will increase the rate of expensive and often ineffective surgical procedures, and they will increase the rate of suicides.  As you can see this will further drive up total medical costs for everyone.  Therefore, I strongly recommend that this proposal not be approved as it prevents both Chronic and Intractable Pain patients from receiving opioids which allow them to have some quality of life.

likely to have trouble.  Each of the 5 available NOACs have specific characteristics and are NOT interchangeable.  We also 
follow-up at select time intervals with patients to find out how they are doing and if they are bleeding or have had a blood clot.

I could find no pain management doctor that would order any pain meds. The skewed facts from Dr. Kolony of the CDC started this disaster. I had been on high doses of opioids for over 20+ years. After finding the proper level that worked for me, I maintained this for many years. I had remained in fairly good health with my only issues being sciatica, scoliosis, radiculopathy, DDD, and osteopenia. I did my yearly mammagrams, yearly physicals including necessary screenings and overall health was good. I am underweight with a BMI of 17. Now without my routine pain meds that remained unchanged in strength, I have unrelenting pain 24/7. I am unable to exercise as I put in over 10,000 steps a day plus walking nightly for w miles with my dogs, I am becoming weaker and at risk for fractures. I can no longer take care of my disabled adult daughter, my spouse, my pets, and my home. I can't attend to errands nor doctor visits. I can not take care of me and mine. There are so many of us in the same situation and no hope in site. Chronic pain is real, and a result of injuries, birth, or genetics, it needs treatment. To not provide same is to allow a group of people to suffer needlessly. Your allowing additional harm, change in health, change in one's ability to move as best we can, to drift into a major depressive state where suicide becomes one answer to the endless pain. The other might be a seeking of illegal drugs, whose chemistry is unknown and not regulated. Those that chose this route, and can find a dealer risk death. Is that what we are calling ""pain management now? 
Chrinic pain patients were NEVER your issue, nor were our doctors who do take additional training in pain management. They know more than the doctor at the CDC, or the people at the DEA, or the insurance companies, or medicaid or medicare, and hospitals.
We know what works for us, an probably know more than all the groups previously mentioned. You are not our doctor, you have not examined us, talked to us, prescribed to us, drawn urines from us, done pull counts wirh us, signed pain contracts with us, afford additional procedures to help with pain to us. YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT US. Please allow are physicians to go back to treating us. Turn around all these ridiculous rules, suggestions an limits which do nothing but further harm us. At some point, I hope, there is/are lawyers out there willing to address this very scandalous, poor fact finding, and warped statitics to control, then harm, then kill so many people. All these agencies are practicing medicine without a license. There is proven harm to borh patient and doctor due to negligence, and malpractice. Add to that additional pain an suffering, assault an battery. 
Our physical treatment should be done by doctors who physically see us, talk to us an exam us. This never was crazed doctors ordering large doses for us. They offer adjunct procedures to go along with our pain management. If the procedures are successful then we may have a trial of medicine reduction to see if the pain is somewhat controlled by whatever was done. There was always an option to go back to the dose we were on, or keep the lower dose. Our doctors worked with us, not against us. 
The result of blaming us for ""the crisis"" has been; loss of the doctors who cared for us, the severe reduction or total withdrawal of our medication leaving us in withdrawal, without support, or increase in pain therefore causing us to withdraw from our daily life.
You need to apologize an remove all ""suggestions"", allowing our doctors to treat us again. You also need to instruct pharmacist and pharmacies to fill the script the doctor writes for us. There role is to advise, or educate, not practice medicine.
The problem is ""illegal drugs"" and the people who are addicted to them. Be it heroin, illegal fentanyl, methamphetamines, or benzodiazepines, these are THE PROBLEM. The addicts need rehab, not jail, ( as the DEA is so fond of,)and Portugal and a few other European countries have excellent programs for you to copy.
It's time for medicine to go back to ""caring for those who come to you"" for care. To have doctors treat their patients, and allow them to do so without all these ""enforced"" suggestions. 
It may be that legal measures may be sought for our ""selected, oppressed"" group of patients. Maybe the ACLU, or an attorney might come to our aide, which would be a horrible way to force proper care. Negligence, medical malpractice, assault and battery along with pain,and suffering are all excellent reasons for suing.

is the one doctor that has prescribed this for me, unless I had an acute problem, i.e.  tooth extraction, a bad fall, severe back muscle spasms, or
the broken ribs I had this past January.  

In the ""CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain  United States, 2016 Prepared by Deborah Dowell,

 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia"" 

""Patients can experience persistent pain that is not well controlled. There are clinical, psychological, and social consequences
 associated with chronic pain including limitations in complex activities, lost work productivity, reduced quality of life, and stigma,
 emphasizing the importance of appropriate and compassionate patient care 
(4). Patients should receive appropriate pain treatment based on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks of treatment
 options. Chronic pain has been variably defined but is defined within this guideline as pain that typically lasts >3 months
 or past the time of normal tissue healing (5). Chronic pain can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition,
 injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or an unknown cause""

If my access to adequate pain control is limited by CDC guidelines or any other policy adaptations, my quality of life will be greatly 
impacted.  Even though I have many chronic conditions that cause me severe pain at times, I have never abused or misused
any medication.  I do not take pain meds, even Tylenol, unless I absolutely have to.  I normally have hydrocodone prescriptions
of 30 tablets last me for over six months.  However, I do need to keep them on hand in case I have an onset of severe pain
when my doctor's office is closed.  Like I said earlier, I  have been chronically ill for over 20 years, I would guess that I have 
averaged taking 45 or less pills per year.  

I have many friends that also have the same chronic health issued that I have, I know that they also only take pain medication
when it is absolutely necessary.

As I mentioned earlier, I recently broke two ribs.  My doctor was only able to prescribe a minimal amount of pain medication to be
me because of opiod guideline already in place.  It took 6 weeks for my ribs to heal.  I ran out of medication and just suffered.

Because of m my Scleroderma, I have many problems with my teeth.  I am looking at either having all my lower teeth pulled and 
getting a plate or having implants.  Also because of the Scleroderma, I have heightened pain sensitivity, so I have been putting 
this off for over a year.  I can't imagine going through these dental procedures without pain medication.

In addition to lack of adequate pain control affecting my quality of life, it will be severely detrimental to the life of my parents.
I am an only child, 60 years old, with all the health issues listed above, trying to take care of my parents who are 85 years old.
My father lives with me and has his own chronic conditions, I have to cook for him, take him to the doctor, get his prescriptions 
filled, make sure he takes his medication properly, do his  laundry, etc.  If I am in severe pain, I will be unable to care for him.
My mother fell and broke her hip nine years ago and she cannot walk so she is in a nursing home.  She depends on me to visit 
her, make sure she has the toiletries she needs, keep her clothes up and to be her health care advocate. Again, without pain
management, I will be unable to care for her.

If the guidelines are adopted, please include a provision for people like me to have a ""case by case"" review. So that we can
1. Substantiate our conclusive and absolute need for pain management.  
2. Keep our fundamental and constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness:
 ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
 Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these
 rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed""  The government
 agency, the  CDC, is accountable to assure this right to those of us with chronic pain conditions, because without pain control,
 there can be no pursuit of happiness.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-1023","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Kimberly Turner, Rocky Mount, NC"

Many of us metabolize medications differently and some are unable to take other medications, including NSAIDs due to gastric bleeding issues.

The number of suicides from unrelieved pain is rising and will continue to do increase if measures like this are taken. Denying people the medical treatment they need to live in less pain is cruel and unusual. This is also a violation of the Hippocratic Oath. There are other ways to respond the the opioid crisis.

Actions like this are going to hurt innocent people. Statistically it is proven the the majority of chronic pain patients do not become addicts. Our lives are difficult and painful enough.

Without these opioid medications--and many are on greater than 90 MME (which is not that high a number if one has been in opioids for years, as one develops a tolerance, NOT an addiction, to this class of drug)--we could not function.  Chronic pain patients rely on opioid medications to allow them to perform functions of daily living, without them many would be bed bound.  Insurance costs for drug coverage already take a great deal of our monthly income; my Blue Cross plan costs me, alone, $864/month.  No one who relies on Medicare coverage has the extra income to purchase medications that are a lifeline, not a luxury or a way to ""get high.""  Opioid-based medications are used to decrease pain levels just enough for us to get out of bed, shower, prepare a meal, or even walk to our mailbox.  None of us can afford to purchase these drugs without insurance coverage, and all of us are heavily screened AND monitored both before and after we are placed on an opioid medication.  We sign contracts, agree to use only one pharmacy, voluntarily submit to a medication count or urine test at the request of our clinicians.  We are held to strict standards, which we are happy to do, as opioid medication is a lifeline.  Without it we could not do the simplest of tasks without great pain.  While 90 MME on paper may appear like a high number, when you have successfully and properly been on opioid medications for years, you develop a tolerance and, under supervision of pain specialists and primary care physicians, our levels are monitored and increased only when clinically necessary.  Today, 90 MME would barely touch my pain, however I have been on pain medications for more than 10 years, and without incident.  Without the supervised use of these medications those living in chronic, constant pain would not only be in unreasonable, inhuman amounts of pain, but would also be unable to live a life of any quality.

CNS-active medication with unique dates of service during the treatment period. Any beneficiary with a hospice indicator 
during the measurement year was excluded.	
We propose to begin reporting the Poly-CNS measure in the Patient Safety reports for the 2018 measurement year. 
We plan to add the measure to the display page for 2021 (2019 data) and 2022 (2020 data). We will consider proposing this 
measure through rulemaking for the 2023 Star Ratings (2021 data).		
Question for CMS: Will sponsors be able to implement safety edits to reject these combinations at point of sale? 
If the combination of this medication is serious enough to monitor, then the answer should be ""yes.""

3.	Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines: This measure assesses the percentage of individuals 18 years and 
older with concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines.	We propose to begin reporting the Concurrent Use of Opioids 
and Benzodiazepines measure in the Patient Safety reports for the 2018 measurement year. We plan to add the measure 
to the display page for 2021 (2019 data) and 2022 (2020 data). We will consider this measure for the 2023 Star Ratings 
(2021 data) pending rulemaking.	
However, we seek feedback if there are concerns with adding this measure for the following reasons: 
(1) The Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) identifies potential opioid over-utilizers who are also receiving a 
benzodiazepine, and 
(2) A proportion of the concurrent opioid and benzodiazepines users will already be identified within the Poly-CNS measure.	
Question for CMS: Will sponsors be able to implement safety edits to reject these combinations at point of sale? 
If the combination of this medication is serious enough to monitor, then the answer should be ""yes.""


4.	Cumulative Morphine Milligram Equivalent Daily Dose (MME) Safety Edits for High, Chronic Prescription Opioid Users		
We further seek comment on when and how to best communicate to beneficiaries that the one-time 7 days supply would 
not be available for future prescriptions should the MME level remain at 90 mg or higher.
Comment for CMS: Perhaps a transition-style letter could be generated for such an occurrence.

"498","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"You are regulating people to death by taking pain medication options from them!!  This WILL kill innocent people - our crime?  Being prisoner to bodies that have betrayed them. In no way our fault, but these Hitleresque ideas have real and deadly consequences. Suffering should NEVER be an acceptable way to 'deal' with any problem. You ARE KILLING US - SUFFERING IS UNACCEPTABLE 

CMS proposes ""all sponsors to implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME), with a 7 days supply allowance.""

Under 42 US Code ~1395, US government agencies are legally restricted from controlling the practice of medicine. Proposed regulation changes are an attempt to subvert that law by injecting financially self-interested insurance companies into control of medical practice as proxies for direct government interference. CMS proposals mandate a dangerous, unfounded and medically unethical intrusion into medical practice by third parties operating without face to face knowledge of the patient. These draconian changes will damage and deny care to large numbers of the 1.6 million patients whom CMS estimates are presently treated with opioids above 90 morphine milligram equivalent dose per day.

It is widely known that CDC Guidelines on which these changes are based are factually in error and biased in their reading of evidence on risks of opioid analgesics. Very few pain patients ever display DSM-5 markers for opioid use disorder. Managed medical exposure to opioids contributes almost nothing to the widely hyped ""opioid crisis"". Drug-related overdoses have risen steadily in the past ten years despite restriction of medical supply -- a death toll entirely associated with nonprescription drugs.

Over-regulation of prescribing is already harming hundreds of thousands of stable patients coerced to reduce doses below therapeutic levels. Mandated VHA restrictions on opioid prescribing are directly responsible for hundreds of deaths among Veterans.

A major study in the January 2018 British Medical Journal illustrates the foolishness of the CMS proposal. Diagnoses of opioid abuse disorder were tracked for 565,000 opioid-nave post-surgical patients followed an average of 2.6 years. Only 0.6% were later diagnosed with OAD. Less than 1% renewed prescriptions up to 13 weeks. OAD incidence was only weakly sensitive to dose level from <20 MME to >120 MME per day. OAD diagnoses were likely made by physicians with little expertise in chronic pain and without reference to formal criteria (DSM). A second large cohort study in JAMA Internal Medicine (Sep 2016) shows incidence of extended post-surgical opioid prescriptions at 0.135%.

CMS is trying to ""solve"" a non-problem by means guaranteed to create far worse problems.

CDC Guidelines ignore genetic polymorphism in the expression of liver enzymes governing opioid metabolism. Imposing hard limits on MMED in ""safety"" audits will cause therapy failure in hundreds of thousands of patients who can benefit from opioids, but only at significantly higher doses than entertained by CDC and this regulation change.

In January 30 public hearings before the FDA Opioid Policy Steering Committee, the American Academy of Pain Management recommended against hard limits on opioid analgesics. Other speakers advocated for leaving practice standards to medical professional associations which guide doctors in each specialty.

There is no one-size-fits-all patient or treatment plan.

Forcing pain patients to go through an ""exceptions"" process before extending prescriptions beyond 7 days is inappropriate and dangerous nonsense. Prevailing practice allows for prescription duration sufficient to treat anticipated pain levels. The alternative is to drown doctors in useless paperwork and to prompt patients to defer needed surgery because they fear being left without pain control.

Proposals for restricting co-prescription of so-called ""potentiating"" drugs like Benzodiazepines, Lyrica or Gabapentin are also problematic. Conclusions regarding adverse effects of combined opioid-benzodiazepine treatment derive entirely from poorly controlled, retrospective case-control studies. Prospective studies of the combination show trivial effects on arterial oxygen saturation. However, under-treatment of anxiety and depression in pain patients are major factors in overdose deaths. Lyrica and Gabapentin are also widely used in seizures, fibromyalgia and neuropathy - conditions which produce disabling pain and mortality risk. There are presently no published data to establish a single reliable threshold criterion for safe use of combinations of these medications. But denial of this option will disable many patients and kill some by iatrogenic suicide.

CMS should stand down from attempting to force restrictions on medical practice which have such predictable and horrid consequences.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0901","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Gayle Onnen-IA"

The past two decades have witnessed increases in
opioid-related morbidity and mortality concomitant with
increases in the prescribing of opioids to treat chronic
pain. State policy-makers, under pressure to do
something about the overdose rate, have intervened.
One such intervention involves the adoption of daily
opioid thresholds in state prescribing policies that,
once reached, will trigger specific actions or recommendations.
Although dosage threshold models continue
to spread across the United States, these
governmental interventions could have serious unintended
outcomes in terms of increased pain and
opioid-related injury and mortality. The following commentary
highlights the evolution of dosage thresholds,
their potential for unintended outcomes, and advocates
for the evaluation of these models and the
adoption of mandatory education-based alternatives,
alternatives that would provide a balanced approach
to the treatment of pain and the prevention of harm
without interfering with the physician-patient
relationship.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0727","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-WA"

I don't take opioids to get high. I take them to feel as well as you feel when you have a cold but that relief allows me to take care of myself and my family. Because of your efforts, my pain management specialist, along with many around the country, are so afraid of losing their licenses and livelihoods that they are forcing ALL of their patients to taper down their medications regardless of the progression of their diseases, how they metabolize their medications, how long they've been on opioids, etc. Since the tapering began, I'm functioning less, suffering more, in greater pain, and quickly becoming depressed.

Please stop getting in between doctors and their patients, and setting limits on the amount of mgs of opioids a person can have daily.

I would be truly unable to go back to a doctor even one week after surgery.  I had bone surgery for my toes which I could not manage to even do crutches, since they caused more pain issues in shoulders.  I had a potty chair next to bed.   
I could not afford home health care. My ex came to help.  
I had a mastectomy for breast cancer and had tunes hanging out of me for a week.  How would I been able to travel when the roads are so bad, the pain excruciating in a car.  I had a splitting oozing open chest from my skin splitting at the incision due to tge EDS.   My doctors in both cases and a later hysterectomy had to prescribe twice another 30 pain pills which did not work as well as would for others.  I had to take massive Tylenol also.  
I am nearing retirement age. I need Medicare. I saved money but on this end my measly $200k won't be enough to take care of my disabled daughter and i.
The other end here is Lyme, which my daughter is disabled from with severe critical pain.  She cant get functional med help because Medicare won't cover it.  She has only 4 total pain pills a day and also has EDS.  they prevent her from imminent suicide. She wants to live but she is being held at a limit which for an EDS pesos should be higher.
She has said to me it would be better to have cancer.  At least one lives or dies, and GETS HELP.  Since gov won't have insurance companies pay for Lyme, I pay for much of basics, needs more but I can't do it. She is suffering no life, has a bite towel in morning, a gofundme for electric wheelchair but you folks don't seem to care that you or one in your family will get Lyme also, and suffer unimaginable pain if it goes undiagnosed.  She lost her previous life at 23, is now 32.  Alone but me and her Dad, who is disabled from railroad.   
Please do not turn your backs on us all who need meds and help.

"515","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient. I have been diagnosed with: Spinal spondylosis, scoliosis with rotation and spinal stenosis. I also have degenerative disk disease, spinal arthritis and bone spurs. On top of that, I have fibromyalgia and MCTD (an autoimmune disease sort of like lupus) I am a healthy weight, eat right, drink maybe once a month, socially. Do all of the lifestyle things that will support my own body.  I have had trigger point injections, facet joint injections and nerve ablation done on my spine.  All offered limited relief. My pain doctor wants me to have an epidural now. My insurance has denied me this procedure until I try physical therapy, which does not work with my diagnosed conditions. I am a widow and work 3 jobs to support myself and I live below the poverty level. I own my home, my car and pay my bills on time.  Could not do one of my jobs and so my family physician placed me on low dose oxycodone so I could continue to be productive member of society and pay my bills while I wait to be given the green light by my insurance for a procedure which has a great chance of helping me. Seems rather ironic to me. We supposedly have this big opioid issue. But the non pain medication procedure is denied me and so I must go on pain meds to keep going to work so I can keep off disability.  Rather ridiculous. Some of us need pain medications to live a life that is somewhat normal. We cannot do it without them. We have tried. If you set this limit, insurance companies will have another excuse to deny us what we need. You will see a rise in drinking (you know that legal, OTC, taxed drug that kills countless every year??) a rise in illicit drug use, a rise in suicide and a rise in disability cases. This issue should be between a patient and their doctor. Our government has no right and no place in my personal care. Addicts are the issue here, not chronic pain patients. Not all of us live near our doctors or pharmacies. For a person who struggles to walk, having to go back to the doctor more frequently is an issue. The vast majority of us take our medications as prescribed and are not addicted.  Dependent yes. But not addicted. There are lots of alcoholics in the world, that cause we the people problems. I do not see anyone putting limits on them. They can walk into any booze store and buy as much as they want. Yet booze is a huge issue; socially, economically and personally for most of us. Seems that accountability has reached an all time low in the US lately. As a pain patient, I am accountable for my use of medicine. Not you, not anyone else. It is between me and my doctor. And I need these medications to be a productive member of society. If you have not lived in unrelenting, severe, not going to go away pain, you have absolutely no frame of reference. Your whole life changes. Everything in it changes, from what you can do to who you are. Being in pain every day also takes a toll on your emotional self. Without relief, it seems hopeless. I know that I for one, will pursue disability if you severely limit my ability to obtain relief through needed, doctor prescribed pain meds. I will have no choices left. I have tried everything else available to me. Limiting my relief will do nothing to stop the addicts either. I urge you to use common sense in this issue. We are citizens of this country and most of us are trying to be normal, productive people.  Severely limiting us, putting all these rules on this, is not a solution. It will create more problems. Are there no elected leaders anymore with any common sense?! By doing this, you punish people who have done no wrong.

The 1993-2002 resolved on it's own and even though I still have a very minute amount of pain from that, it's essentially gone. However, I was injured in 2004 and it turned into a chronic problem along with some degenerative things all with my lower back. It started as a L5-S1 problem and is now a L2-S1 and SI joint problem. Here is a list of the things that are wrong:Compression deformity at L4. Anterolisthesis of L4 on L5; Retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. L2-L3 midline disc protrusion on a diffusely bulging annulus, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening resulting in left neural foraminal narrowing. Severe canal stenosis measuring 5mm. L3-L4 same as L2-L3 with mild stenosis 8mm. And the L3 nerve roots contact the facets bilaterally. L4-L5 disc desiccation and intervertebral disc space height loss. Uncovering of the disc, diffusely bulging annulus, facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening results in moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. Right L4 nerve root is impinged. Stenosis 8mm. L5-S1 same as L4-L5.  So in 2004 I was bucked off a horse and landed full force on my SI joint. I had been a very active person, yoga every day, walked daily (was a dog walker at the shelter) and walked my own dogs, loved to walk and explore out of the way places, did yard work (mowing,planting, raking, etc.), always had projects going on. After this injury after a couple of weeks  of ice/heat, I went to PT, chiropractic, massage, etc. None of this helped in any way. I was prescribed hydrocodone at that time. I had to take it until I could reduce the amount of pain. So now is is 14 years later and over this 14 years I have continued periodically to have PT, chiropractic, massage, had SI joint injection on both sides about a year after the injury, multiple epidurals, tens unit, lidocaine patches, SI joint support belt, Inversion table, gym (trying to get some kind of exercise since too painful to walk now), Yoga (unable to since accident), simple aerobics (too painful), stabilization exercises (did these for 20-25 years) too painful now. None of these helped the pain in any way. I have gone to pain clinics periodically to see if they could help. One did lots of injections none of which helped. He tried some different painkillers plus Lyrica and Neurontin or Gabapentin. The only thing that has any effect on the pain is opiates. I cannot take the GABA drugs. I have taken antidepressants, but I am only very mildly depressed and these drugs do not help the pain and they make my mind go to a very dark place. So I recently started going to a pain clinic again (in October 2017). They did facet injections on 4 levels on one side and it made no difference at all. I had a bunch of trigger point injections done and those didn't help at all either. Right now I am very undertreated for pain. I have been trying to get by on 4 hydrocodone per day. I have never increased it over the past 14 years. The little bit I can do is because of the hydrocodone. I also take lots of aspirin. Please help the chronic pain patients and adjust the CDC prescribing of opiates for chronic pain. There are a lot of us that don't misuse or abuse our medications.

My hard working, loving fiance became disabled because of what a hospital DID TO HIM!  It was NOT HIS FAULT. (And no, we could not sue them, because while they pretended to not know what was wrong with him for 3 weeks while they left him in a hospital bed hooked up to morphine, they were VERY BUSINESS covering up the fact that he fell in their hospital while a patient for pancreatitis, and then gave him a neurosurgeon that left him with 2 spinal fusions and permanent spinal cord, nerve damage, and a broken coccyx bone that grew back backwards because they never bothered to look for other injuries while having him nearly comatose on morphine)  SO while waiting for THREE YEARS with no income waiting for Social Security disability, we lost EVERYTHING WE EVER WORKED FOR.  Became homeless and lived in a tent. Now he can walk to the bathroom, barely, and back to bed. We can't afford to pay rent, and our electric bill on his income. Not enough for Dr bill copays or part D copays. Not enough for bandaid or cream to help with bed sores. OR even a decent mattress for him to suffer on. His wheelchair given to him by a charity has a flat tire. I have a hernia from pushing him in that wheelchair but I don't have insurance because I have NO JOB anymore because I have to take care of HIM! We have a van with a wheelchair lift that has 4 flat tires and needs a new starter, for THREE YEARS and is about to be towed away by our apartment complex. FUN LIFE. The ONLY THING that keeps him halfway comfortable is the pain relief medications that keeps the pain away JUST ENOUGH to keep him from suicide. But you people would LOVE IT IF he committed suicide, right? That's what you're trying to do? Get rid of all these useless dead weight. Well let me tell you something.  The DEA can't make money off prescription medications.  They can only make money off the HEROIN THEY IMPORT.  So that's the main reason you are doing this. The 2nd reason is so you won't have to pay Social Security disability to these losers, right? And another thing. It is NOT MY FIANCE'S FAULT THAT YOUR LOSER LOVED ONES CHOSE TO BREAK THE LAW AND DO DRUGS. IS IT???  NO!! I'm SO SICK of hearing about THEM. They CHOOSE to do it. My fiance? He DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE!  We HAD a beautiful life before this happened. My fiance is the most wonderful person you would ever meet. He is a GOOD PERSON WITH A HUGE HEART.  He didn't DESERVE this! And he CERTAINLY  doesn't deserve to be kicked in the face now, by YOU PEOPLE, who have NO IDEA HOW MUCH HE SUFFERS.  For 16 long disgusting, depressing years he has suffered. There is no joy any more. Maybe you think he deserves to die but he DOES NOT.  He's not ready to give up yet. And he does not deserve to SUFFER MORE because YOUR IDIOT loved ones decided. ....DECIDED  to break the law. I guess we should move to a country that CARES about their SICK and DISABLED people.  You people (using that term loosely)  are more than CRUEL to make him SUFFER MORE because of OTHERS STUPIDITY.  I am beyond angry, and definitely DISGUSTED that we should have to sit here and BEG for SICK PEOPLE TO BE TREATED HUMANELY. We have definitely had enough CRAP FOR 100 lifetimes. My fiance would literally give his right arm for none of this to have happened. We LOVED having a truck, a 300zx, and a motorcycle. A beautiful little apartment overlooking a pool and the ocean. Once a month road trips and dinner out EVERY Friday night. He would give ANYTHING to hike for 10 miles  like we used to, or go to antique stores to treasure shop. Now we have a broken down car and haven't been out to dinner in years and years. We can't even afford cable for him to watch while he lays in an uncomfortable bed and suffers more PAIN THAN YOU WILL EVER IMAGINE. NO.  That's not good enough for you. You think he is sub human, and should suffer more. SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU!!!! YOU ARE THE SUB HUMAN in this scenario as far as I'm concerned. YOU need to use your brains, (and your heart if you have one) and figure out another way. Let your loved ones that CHOSE to do drugs ILLEGALLY suffer. Not my loved one who DIDN'T CHOOSE.  Let the DEA figure out another way to line their pockets and ruin lives. We have had enough and I mean it. This is MORONIC.  I can't believe it, but I should the way this country is going down the tubes. For people to have to sit here and BEG for their SICK and DISABLED loved ones to be treated like a human being.

-	Set life goals (other than find pain relief)

I also wanted to share how this current culture of pain meds being bad is dangerous and/or a need to be eradicated. There is a place for pain meds for chronically ill patients (not just cancer or palliative care). Medicare needs to take their lead from those doctor who are trained in pain management!!!!!!!  Please let these educated and professional pain specialists guide you in understanding the role pain meds play in health care.  

PS - Don't let the street drugs, heroin, fentanyl and all illegal drugs impact the role pain meds play in the treatment of chronically ill patients. 

PPS - ILLEGAL DRUGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY AND STATISTICS NEED To BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE REAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE STREET DRUGS ESPECIALLY FENTANYL.  ADDITIONALLY, IN PATIENT TREATMENT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR HELP.)

The installation of the pump nearly killed her. She has endured dozens of injections, untold hours of physical therapy - all resulting in making her quality of life worse. The therapy of last resort that has been anywhere close to allowing her to live a normal life has been opioid medication.
  If Medicare/Medicaid refuses to to pay for her medication, I am in great fear of what could be in store for her next. Will she become suicidal? Turn to the streets for relief? I don't know how much more she can handle.
  Proposed policies are not supported by studies, everyone metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have politically or personally profited from the outcome, a thought that literally makes me ill.
 Please consider the chronic pain/CRPS/RSD patients and others that legitimately rely on such medications to maintain their life as they are the ones being hurt the most  in this war on opioid patients.
  As history has taught us, it's best to leave medical decisions between patients and their doctors. Although many may mean well in considering these new regulations, there are ALWAYS unintended consequences when government becomes a party in making decisions that should be left to medical professionals.
  It is easy to see how these policies could create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment and need for social services. Opioid prescriptions have been going down due to pressure from the DEA on Doctors for the past 10 years while overdosing due to illicit street drugs is increasing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

These diseases cause chronic, excruciating pain and those managing my care and have tried hundreds of different therapies and medicines to help alleviate my suffering and the medicines that provides the most relief are opioids.

It would make more sense if you offerred effective alternatives to pain medicines, but at least from my perspective that's not happening.

Please do not limit or restrict opioids for pain patients, do not increase deductibles or co-pays because the very people who need this live on limited incomes.  Please do not make ridiculous rules which require the disabled to go back to their doctors weekly for refills. The doctors I see are DOCTORS. I trust their judgement, frankly more than I trust the judgement of a government or insurance company who apparently has no compassion for the least in our communities.

What about all the illegal drugs on our streets. Isn't this mostly about the vast amount of illegal fentanyl that's reaching our cities? Is this a war on drugs or a war on pain medication?

"530","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a Pain Management physician in Washington state. I am aware that CMS is considering creating severe restrictions regarding the prescription of opioids to chronic pain patients. I wish to make my strong objection to these changes. A limit of 90 MED of opioids as recommended in the CDC guidelines is a grave error in judgment that will lead to many deaths and injuries from those who purport to protect patients from opioids. There is little scientific basis for this ceiling dose because the studies, including those from the State of Washington AMDG, are very poorly done. The people recommending these dose restrictions do not represent the consensus of the pain physicians in this country. They include people from Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing who are addiction specialists, psychiatrists, and avidly anti-opioid advocates. Missing are the opinions of pain management professional societies such as the American Academy of Pain Management, Academy of Integrative Medicine, and patient advocacy groups like US Pain Foundation and others. The effect of these policies would take pain management prescribing decisions away from pain physicians and put them into the hands of bureaucrats and insurance companies...those who have a financial interest in limiting opioids due to cost savings...not in saving lives.

By limiting access to opioids, many chronic pain patients will, and already have, resorted to more dangerous and less effective means of treating their pain. Some over-utilize anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen products with their risks of GI bleeding, kidney, and liver failure. Some resort to alcohol and tobacco with their well-known risks. Some resort to street drugs with its lack of physician oversight and exposure to more dangerous drugs like heroin and carfentanyl.  Some become more disabled and must give up their ability to take care of themselves, others, or work. Some resort to suicide as the only answer they see available. There have been no studies to assess the impact of these dose limiting policies on those chronic pain patients' health and behaviors. CMS should not codify such limitations without knowing what the impact of these policies is likely to be. That is irresponsible and cruel.

In a pain management practice, studies have shown, that with proper vetting and monitoring with urine drug screening, prescription monitoring, pill counts, and functional improvement, few...4% or less become addicted to their medications. This small percentage of patients are identified early on with the screening I listed, with appropriate referrals to addiction specialists provided immediately. That's only 1 in 20 who develop addiction. Meanwhile 19 in 20 don't become addicted! 

One driving assumption that the anti-opioid advocated falsely claim is that the over-prescribing of opioids by physicians is the root cause of the opioid epidemic.  This is false.  The number of opioid prescriptions has been going down sinde 2010 while the numbers of abusers of heroin and fentanyl products has steadily increased. The vast majority of current addicts got their opioids off the streets, including counterfeit prescriptions drugs from China and Mexico. Many addicts who started using prescription opioids from a physician's office were going to pill mills where anyone could obtain these drugs. The vast majority of these people did not really have chronic pain.

Most overdose deaths which occurs with real pain patients are due to a combination of medications including opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and other sedating agents.  The answer to prevent such occurences comes with proper training and education of physicians who prescribe opioids and educating patients to avoid using these drugs in combination unless it is closely supervised by a physician who can provide adequate justification for taking the risks of combining use of these drugs. 

As for the treatment of acute pain, physicians and dentists need training in either using non-opioids or knowing how to properly screen patients for addiction risk. There are several excellent instruments to do so, including Opioid Risk Tool, SOAPP-R, COMM, and psychological tests for depression, PTDS, panic disorder, and others. PDMP and urine drug screens can be easily performed in physician offices and ERs before dispensing opioids to acute trauma victims. 

The problem of the current opioid epidemic will not be solved by severe limitations of opioids to chronic pain patients...who are not a significant part of the drug abusing population. Please forestall such policies until studies can be done to determine whether it is even a safe policy. There is now a bandwagon effect where government agencies, payors, and politicians are looking for a quick and easy solution by restricting access to those who really benefit from the use of opioids. CMS should not experiment on these unfortunate people.

When I was employed I started with very low dosage and had random pill counts and urinalysis like I was some kind drug addicted does not make you feel good. So after many years of treatment with medication I mean mostly every kind before giving opiate medication a try this alone gave me years of more employment. In 2012 I just could not do it anymore work that is the hardest thing I ever did was stop. I mean it is like life as you know it is over and there is no retirement there is just living one day at a time. So after my HMO coverage stop I was on 120Mg of morph long lasting and 30mg of breakthrough medication. I went to the VA and was given a great doctor that really helped me. Then after one year he was retired not by choice my first visit with my new VA doctor he told me he read all my records and he was going to save my life and cut my medication in half and the next month he cut down again I complained and was told this is new VA even I sign pain  contracts and did what they said I had no say. I have to be honest and say I was very close to ending my life. We then moved to California for my wife and after coming here and having to start over with treatment like nothing I had gone through before mattered. I decided to try my Medicare and got referred to a pain  specialist that saved my life and gave me back some I lost over 20lbs and even have bought a house. So everything great right no. I cannot get my  prescriptions filled at any place were I live CVS,Ritaid,Walgreens etc..and have to drive 40miles to get them.

The reason I am writing this is to hopefully help you appreciate how critical her high dose medication has been for her survival. I know you have heard this from many others, but I am convinced without this treatment my wife would not be alive today given the constant and extreme pain she was experiencing.  The suffering was too great and extended for anyone to have to endure. 

She has suffered from multiple traumatic head and neck injuries as well as cancer, that made it difficult or impossible for her to function and lead a normal life.  She had seizures, constant pain, unable to do basic things at home even great difficulty reading and regular extreme attacks of pain.   We went to countless clinics and doctors who promised to cure her but did not find meaningful relief until being under the care of a physician understanding her issues and providing sufficient medication to address her extreme pain.  Under this care she has improved very substantially, no more emergency room visits, reading comfortably, even playing with her grandchildren.

My wife and I are terrified at the thought of her living the rest of her life with continuing deterioration and agony, without continued high dose levels.  As you know these medications are extremely expensive and without Medicaid coverage we could not afford them. Please consider what a devastating impact it will have to so many people if this proposal is passed.

I've been in severe pain for years before finally getting help at the elite pain management clinic here. Before I started my treatment I couldn't even walk 20 without collapsing simply because my pain was to great and spent all of my time curled up in bed crying because it hurt so badly. Due to the fact that I was diagnosed at 18 I've never drank. It just wasn't safe. So I am incredibly careful with my medication because I know if Ioose it I won't be able to care for my 12 year old daughter or even do menial tasks like loading the dishwasher.

"540","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Putting limits on pain medication will cause great harm to Medicare Recipients. I am not a Medicare user yet but will be in the near future. Thru the years I have watched my body deteriorate and know that the DDD, nerve damage, tarsal coalition syndrome, and arthritis will not get better with age. It horrifies me that adequate pain medicine is under threat and people, some of which cannot speak for themselves, will be forced to suffer in agony. 

As a 16yr Chronic Pain Patient, 7yrs treated with high dose pain medicine, I was able to run a household, be a wife, mother, grandmother, and  caregiver. Even though I had limitations from pain I had an acceptable Quality Of Life. I lost all that December 2016. I am now on 1/4 of previous dose and am no longer able to function at the same level.

I did not choose this life of pain and do not take pain medicine to get high. There is no reasonable explanation to justify the lowering of a medication that has been successfully used for years that allowed me to function as a productive person. 

I am, as many others, living proof that longterm use and high dose pain medicine has a place in the treatment of pain. There is absolutely no logic in the recent narrative that these changes are to prevent overdose and addiction in patients that have successfully used pain medicine for many years. 

If these changes are made to Medicare it will result in even more untreated and under treated pain. We have already seen drastic cuts in pain medication due to the 2016 CDC Guidelines. It has caused great suffering among Chronic Pain Patients, Disabled, Elderly, and Veterans. Patients recovering from surgery are no longer being adequately treated for pain. The attempt to stop addiction is spiraling out of control leaving patients who need pain care as collateral damage. Please let common sense back into medicine and allow Doctors to properly treat patients with pain.

CMS proposes ""all sponsors to implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME), with a 7 days supply allowance.""

Under 42 US Code ~1395, US government agencies are legally restricted from controlling the practice of medicine.  Proposed regulation changes are an attempt to subvert that law by injecting financially self-interested insurance companies into control of medical practice as proxies for direct government interference.  CMS proposals mandate a dangerous, unfounded and medically unethical intrusion into medical practice by third parties operating without face to face knowledge of the patient. These draconian changes will damage and deny care to large numbers of the 1.6 million patients whom CMS estimates are presently treated with opioids above 90 morphine milligram equivalent dose per day. 
 
It is widely known that CDC Guidelines on which these changes are based are factually in error and biased in their reading of evidence on risks of opioid analgesics.  Very few pain patients ever display DSM-5 markers for opioid use disorder.  Managed medical exposure to opioids contributes almost nothing to the widely hyped ""opioid crisis"". Drug-related overdoses have risen steadily in the past ten years despite restriction of medical supply -- a death toll entirely associated with nonprescription drugs. 

Over-regulation of prescribing is already harming hundreds of thousands of stable patients coerced to reduce doses below therapeutic levels.  Mandated VA restrictions on opioid prescribing are directly responsible for hundreds of deaths among Veterans.  

A major study in the January 2018 British Medical Journal illustrates the foolishness of the CMS proposal.  Diagnoses of opioid abuse disorder were tracked for 565,000 opioid-nave post-surgical patients followed an average of 2.6 years. Only 0.6% were later diagnosed with OAD.  Less than 1% renewed prescriptions up to 13 weeks.  OAD incidence was only weakly sensitive to dose level from <20 MME to >120 MME per day.  OAD diagnoses were likely made by physicians with little expertise in chronic pain and without reference to formal criteria (DSM).  A second large cohort study in JAMA Internal Medicine (Sep 2016) shows incidence of extended post-surgical opioid prescriptions at 0.135%.  

CMS is trying to ""solve"" a non-problem by means guaranteed to create far worse problems.

CDC Guidelines ignore genetic polymorphism in the expression of liver enzymes governing opioid metabolism.  Imposing hard limits on MMED in ""safety"" audits will cause therapy failure in hundreds of thousands of patients who can benefit from opioids, but only at significantly higher doses than entertained by CDC and this regulation change.  

In January 30 public hearings before the FDA Opioid Policy Steering Committee, the American Academy of Pain Management recommended against hard limits on opioid analgesics.  Other speakers advocated for leaving practice standards to medical professional associations which guide doctors in each specialty.  

There is no one-size-fits-all patient or treatment plan.
  
Forcing pain patients to go through an ""exceptions"" process before extending prescriptions beyond 7 days is inappropriate and dangerous nonsense.  Prevailing practice allows for prescription duration sufficient to treat anticipated pain levels.  The alternative is to drown doctors in useless paperwork and to prompt patients to defer needed surgery because they fear being left without pain control. 

Proposals for restricting co-prescription of so-called ""potentiating"" drugs like Benzodiazepines, Lyrica or Gabapentin are also problematic. Conclusions regarding adverse effects of combined opioid-benzodiazepine treatment derive entirely from poorly controlled, retrospective case-control studies.  Prospective studies of the combination show trivial effects on arterial oxygen saturation.  However, under-treatment of anxiety and depression in pain patients are major factors in overdose deaths.  Lyrica and Gabapentin are also widely used in seizures, fibromyalgia and neuropathy - conditions which produce disabling pain and mortality risk.  There are presently no published data to establish a single reliable threshold criterion for safe use of combinations of these medications.   But denial of this option will disable many patients and kill some by iatrogenic suicide. 

CMS should stand down from attempting to force restrictions on medical practice which have such predictable and horrid consequences.

My wife has suffered from chronic pain for several years due to fibromyalgia and a number of chronic, degenerative orthopedic concerns. After trying many alternatives for pain relief in the past with inadequate therapeutic benefit, she worked with her physician on a pain management plan that includes both long-acting and short-acting opioid pain medications. 

This treatment plan had been a successful and stable way for her to manage her pain sufficiently for her to participate in activities that she enjoyed and that were good for her overall well being, including art activities and physical exercise training. Recently, however, she was forced to change doctors because her prior physician transferred to a network not covered by her insurance. Because of pressure to follow the CDC's published recommendation of avoiding pain management through prescription of opioid medications in amounts >90 MME, she has now found herself unable to find a replacement doctor who is willing to continue her previously-successful pain management regimen, even though the CDC's recommendations are not binding and are not based on studies of long-term chronic pain patients for whom doses of >90 MME are therapeutically beneficial and reasonably medically necessary. Instead, she is being forced to reduce the beneficial use of these medications notwithstanding her multi-year history of medically appropriate use. 

The result has already been very harmful to my wife's well being, and her doctor is not yet done trying to further reduce her medication. Her pain has consistently returned to levels where it is debilitating to her, and levels which get in the way of her ability to participate in activities that she wants and needs for her physical and social benefit. She can no longer stay ahead of her pain, and is being forced, unnecessarily, to suffer from pain that until a few months ago was being well managed. She consistently has pain on a level of 6+ on a scale of 0-10 now, whereas with the previously-effective pain management plan she was consistently on 2-3 pain level. She is suffering unnecessarily. After attempts at exercise in the last couple of weeks, she has found herself having to use a walker to help her get around the house because her pain levels are too high for her to walk.

It is clear to us that pain doctors are increasingly unwilling to look out for the best interests of their patients because they are overly concerned about ""what the numbers might look like"" when it comes to prescriptions for opioid medications, even in cases like my wife's, where she had been on an effective and beneficial long-term pain management plan. My wife was on the previously-prescribed doses, >90 MME, because multiple attempted alternatives had been unsuccessful in managing her pain. Now, the pain management doctors she has spoken with in trying to find a replacement for the doctor she can no longer see all simply tell her that they essentially don't care what her pain level is; they intend to get her down to < or = 90 MME, pain consequences be damned. Doctors are effectively being encouraged to callously under-treat patients who suffer from chronic pain. This is absurd.

This is an awful set of circumstances to thrust upon the many people in this country who suffer from chronic pain that until recently has been effectively managed by opioid pain medications who follow carefully-supervised treatment plans. It is very important to people like my wife that it be made clear to doctors that they should not be so worried about intrusions into their doctor-patient relationships that they don't feel free to prescribe levels of medication that actually work and are medically necessary to effectively treat chronic pain.

My wife's current inability to effectively treat her pain, coupled with concerns that her circumstances will only become worse if these recommendations are followed without compassion and very reasonable exceptions for chronic pain sufferers, is leading her to lose hope that she'll be able to cope with a life where she is in so much pain. For my wife to be placed in this situation is nothing short of wholly unreasonable.

From my own perspective, I am concerned that this continuing trend will drive my wife to take unthinkable actions because she can't tolerate the pain. I am concerned that she will not be able to walk, she will not be able to participate in life, and will lose all hope of having a future not consumed by unbearable pain. We should not have these concerns and she should not have to suffer unnecessarily.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0220","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-02T00:00:00-05:00","Dan Jones-CO"

The neck pain was consistently increasing for over a decade. My Pain Doctor decided to prescribe opioids that were for long term use as short acting medication would leave gaps in my pain control. I worked for the State of California for 23 years before I had to retire on Social Security Disability at 48. I had an appointment with my boss to tell him that I needed to retire. I started crying on the way and had to leave work.I could not compose myself to tell him I was retiring. This is not supposed to happen, this is not my plan for retirement. I fought through pain so hard and for so long for it to come to this was heartbreaking. As I was waiting the one year to get SS Disability approved I complained to my doctor that my back was acting up and it was going on longer than usual. A MRI revealed I had a new ruptured lumbar disk. I had the surgery and woke up in more pain than before. I never got better and Kaiser sent me back to the pain clinic for more pills. I spent the next year interviewing 4 top surgeons in the San Francisco area out of my pocket. Also I had an issue with Social Security and Medicare and could not change insurance plans without Medicare and it was 8 months to Open Enrollment. The pain got worse and I ended up in a wheel chair as I could only walk a few feet from bed to bathroom. I was completely bedridden, missing out on life and lonely. I asked Kaiser to refer me to UCSF for the corrective surgery which they have done for many patients. Kaiser made me make my case to a 3rd Kaiser Surgeon as the first two told me there were ""no more surgical options for me"". The 3rd Surgeon said he could find me a Surgeon somewhere in the Kaiser system who and refused to refer me. I am now set for my revision surgery with UCSF, my surgeon does a full spine MRI to prepare. A few days before surgery we meet and he tells me I have scoliosis and disks that have worn away in the thoracic spine. He considers doing a 10 level fusion all the way down to S1. I want to stick to the plan so I can get up and walking so I'd be in better shape if I needed that surgery later. I came out of surgery with screaming neuropathy in my legs and feet, something I did not have prior to surgery. I couldn't even notice my back pain as the neuropathy pain left me screaming. I spent the next 6 months going to see all the specialists at UCSF. I was diagnosed with neuropathy, CRPS, and Adhesive Arachnoiditis - or a mix of all 3. I tried various combinations of medicines that would fit in with meds I was currently taking. I have been taking the medicines I'm on now for 1 year. All 2017-2018 my Medicare pharmacy OptumRx would month after month refuse to fill my opioids until my doctor answered a questions. Then they would get approved and mailed to me. All this back and forth took about 7 days for a 30 day prescription. Then 2 months later they would do the same thing. I have never increased my opioid medication.I have a Pain Doctor at UCSF, #1 Hospital in US, but still the relentless questioning. This month I am on my last 3-day Fentanyl patch for 7 days so far and I expect it will take another 3 days by mail. I could not get it locally as all Walgreen's had the Fentanyl patch recalled so they have none in stock. I meet with my Pain Doctor tomorrow to discuss what happens if I start to go into withdrawals. The ER? I have spent my whole life fighting and I'm tired. I'm disabled and in a lot of pain daily. The opioids take the edge off so I can function some days and meet a friend for lunch, and that's about it. I will never dance at my wedding but with the help of Opioids I hope to at least enjoy it. After 35 years in intense pain, medication, and a medical record to show it, I ask that once checked you leave it up to my Pain Doctor to decide what is right for me. Go after the real abusers of the ""opiod epidemic"" and leave true Chronic Pain patients alone. Please help us, our lives are literally depending on it.

In my humble opinion a strict certification process should be enacted to qualify steering committees and individuals serving on the committees authorized to make decisions that will either positively or negatively impact direct patient care, patient therapies, treatment protocols, providers, and patient outcomes. We are reaching critical levels in this country (critical means potential harm vs benefit to any patient as well as providers caring for them). Healthcare professionals should require any individual involved in making final decisions that will impact patient care on any committee to undergo a preceptorship with a RN, PA, NP or MD (so that what they observe is real and not staged) in a care setting such as intensive care, post operate unit, emergency room, medical surgical units, acute care areas, trauma, and more to observe what is really happening in direct care and learn more about disease processes and the patient/provider experience with all modalities of pain. The observance should include both sides...the labeled ""addicts; abusers"", and the ""legitimate"" patients with validated painful acute and chronic conditions or diseases.

The real tragedy in the war on pain are the unintended casualties; the patients who have validated painful chronic and/or terminal illnesses or documented painful acute conditions that interfere with their quality of life. There are patients living with pain that do rely on treatment with pain medication short or long-term or a combination of both to allow them to have better quality of life. They are living daily with a painful disease or condition that traditional therapies cannot cure. These individuals are responsible meaning that they attend every appointment, take their medication as prescribed, and follow physician's orders as instructed. They accept that they will live with chronic pain and also accept no one and no medication can eradicate the pain entirely. These individuals are contributing members of society including our neighbors, family, friends, retired doctors, retired nurses, philosophers, scientists, etc. They continue to contribute to our society in positive ways. Chronic painful diseases, painful terminal illnesses, and painful acute illnesses or injuries all have a commonality and that is immense emotional and physical suffering if pain is left untreated. Sadly we are now observing patients with painful conditions who have no access to medications or therapies with zero options taking their lives.

As medical professionals we MUST unite and address both sides of this now! Our colleagues, brothers and sisters who have documented painful diseases or illnesses fight daily to make it to the next day and deserve our ongoing support for continued excellent compassionate patient care that includes adequate pain management that is not a ""one size fits all"" approach; rather a customized plan for each individual based on their needs as determined by their healthcare team.

Please Note: The decision to draft this article was out of concern for both patient and provider safety. As an experienced registered nurse who serves as both clinical leader and patient advocate there is a strong message we should all heed. My overall message is this: **The unintended consequence of the war on opioids and pain with its media feeding frenzy and political tug of war is the continued creation of multiple barriers to access for adequate pain prevention, access to treatment and barriers to therapies that are already hurting vulnerable patients and providers who are innocent bystanders. **

If you want to make changes and put more money back into the government, consider slashing some of the outrageous paychecks that Congress gets, also what about slashing some of their health benefits, because they can afford that. Also the tax reform that just passed gives great benefits to Big corporations and the top 1%, I'm not sure why that happened but the money could have come from that.

"575","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a hospice and palliative medicine board certified physician and I am very concerned about the impact of these regulations on patients who have been diagnosed with a serious life-limiting illness. 

In particular, I am concerned with the limit of 90 oral morphine equivalents per day, which is often inadequate for cancer patients with refractory pain or metastatic disease. It is not a reasonable standard for some patient populations and was designed for chronic pain not all opioid prescribing (""pain lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care"" - https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/guideline.html). Some patients at the end of their lives require much higher doses of pain medications, and having hard limits (even 200) may ensure that patients end up hospitalized for pain crisis throughout the course of their illness and at the end of their lives die in hospitals away from their families because they cannot get medications to control their pain at home. While the CMS regulations do note there may be an exception for cancer patients or patients on hospice, there is no clear way identified for clinicians to note this status so that the prescription may go through. Patients with cancer diagnoses are already having prescriptions denied despite multiple calls by their clinicians to pharmacies/insurers and are ending up in hospitals due to increased scrutiny of opioids. 

In terms of concurrent use of medications like gabapentin and pregabalin with opioids, these medications treat different types of pain - neuropathic pain is generally more responsive to medications like gabapentin or pregabalin as opposed to opioids. Some patients have different types of pain (for example, chemotherapy can cause nerve damage and subsequent stabbing/shooting nerve pain as opposed to the bony or visceral organ pain from cancer metastases) and may need to be on both types of medication. Using gabapentin may actually decrease the total amount of opioids a patient uses, whereas limiting use of neuropathic agents may actually increase opioid use over time.

While we need to be cautious about medication prescribing and find ways to reasonably limit opioids, setting hard limits without any clear mechanism for identifying patients who reasonably need higher levels of medications just makes it easier for insurance companies to refuse prescriptions, and result in more hospitalizations of patients in crisis. In addition, several portions of this guideline are vague, or seemingly contradict sentences above (""Clinically, there is little support for maintaining a patient on multiple different opioids and such use creates other health care issues."" vs ""Lastly, we recognize that multiple LA opioid prescriptions of different strengths can be clinically appropriate so we examined the impact of requiring different opioid prescribers"") - Please consider revisions in consultation with additional pain management and palliative physicians.

To Whom It May Concern,     
I am writing this comment to plead with you, that you consider the plight of the chronically ill when it comes to limiting the amount of medication my doctor can prescribe for me, that my insurance will allow, that my state monitors, that you want to limit to 90 MEMg for Medicare and Medicaid policy holders.  I am not yet a Medicare recipient, but it is only a year or less away.  I currently have a commercial insurance whose policies follow Medicare policy. 
Four years ago I would never have believed that I would be writing this note, that I would even have an awareness of pain medications. I was working full time and spent any free time hiking and kayaking, almost always with my camera. I had recently started night astrophotography, spending nights out under the stairs, ""shooting the Northern Lights"".  Two years ago, I applied for and was hired for my dream job. Life couldn't be any better.  Except, my legs had been hurting some, and I was feeling kind of awful really, but my approach to illness had always been to work through it, keep pushing and it will go away. Right? But this time it didn't.  I won't bore you with all the medical details, nor list my ailments and autoimmune diseases.  I have struggled to keep that dream job, but I can no longer leave my house most days. To shower and dress takes about four hours, and then the rest of the day to recuperate. The only way I can walk is to wear braces on my legs and to take pain medication. It looks like this is going to be a permanent condition, never getting better, almost certainly getting worse. My bones are crumbling. When I move, the pieces of bones saw at my nerves and pinch the tendons. My ankle bone won't stay in place anymore, and moves around to the front of my foot.  This is the first joint to be affected, but not the last. So far my feet, ankles and knees are involved. Oh, and the seven herniated discs in my back. There are pages of other things that go on when you have Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitius, and so far I am lucky. My kidneys still work, and my lung function is almost normal. My brain, they say, is unaffected as yet, though there are some who wonder about that. The awful rashes and sores have been controlled by the meds, so far.  But the pain is debilitating. Without the pain medication, I cannot get out of bed to get to the bathroom by myself. I fall, I scream, I pick myself up and I keep going. But as more bones crumble and more nerves are sawed at by ragged bits of bone, and tendons rip and become disconnected, my pain has increased to beyond anything I ever could have imagined.  My dose has not increased, it has come down. My pain management doc left her practice due to harassment from the state and the DEA. She left 1200 patients in a rural area with no one to help them.  Those 1200 people can no longer work or participate in their family activities. Their health declines as they can no longer be active.  1200 people who are applying for disability, who need home care, who can no longer drive or even leave their homes. They are losing homes, their credit is shot. They can't pay their bills. They can't get out of bed. All for no reason other than to supposedly help with addiction. And this is just one doctor of many who are leaving pain management, retiring, or just plain quitting. We have already seen, the CDC has already documented that this isn't working. Prescription medications are not the problem. Illicit fentanyl and heroin are the drugs that are killing addicts. They are coming here in the mail, mostly from China. Since 2014, the number of prescriptions written in the United States has gone down considerably, but overdose deaths have increased drastically.  It is apparent to even the most  obtuse that what we are doing isn't working. We are going down the wrong path. 
I have so much more I'd like to say, but I am exhausted and hurting. I am struggling to type, to hold my head up until my next dose of the medication that allows me to function. My doctors have said I'm on a low dose, and sometimes I feel so sad, to think that just one more pill a day would allow me to continue working, to be a contributing member of society.
But anyway, why do we need to discriminate, to deny sick people their medication in order to help people who abuse illicit drugs? Or whatever else they can get their hands on? Why does it have to be one or the other? Already, chronically ill people are killing themselves because they cannot stand the level of 24/7 pain they live with, without medications that are readily available, that they have taken responsibly for years, but now are reduced or completely taken away. Please at least allow the people who have been on doses higher than 90 MEMg, to stay on those doses. I understand that you want to keep up the facade of caring about people, but do you not think that it would be kinder and more honest to simply end our lives quickly? 

Thank you, 
Jean Hughes

This appears to be a foundational statement to justify changes in the Part D Opioid Overutilization Policy. However, the referenced CDC guideline opens with this statement: ""This guideline provides recommendations for primary care clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.""

This shows that the guideline is written for primary care clinicians, not all doctors who prescribe opioids for chronic pain. For example, it is not written to apply to pain specialists. The guideline also says that primary care clinicians can ""carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to 90 MME/day.""

The proposed changes to the Part D Opioid Overutilization Policy do not seem to accommodate those facts. For example, the proposed changes do not seem to be limited to primary care clinicians. Consequently, the grounds for the changes proposed in the Advance Notice are invalid, and those changes should not be implemented without fully accounting for all aspects of the CDC guideline.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0384","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","CA"

"592","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Hello,

I am a 65 year-old Medicare beneficiary with multiple medical diagnoses including chronic pain. I have suffered from chronic pain after the removal of a kidney due to a botched AAA repair. I have been on a stable dose of pain medication for over 6 years.

I want to make it clear that I do not:
1. Doctor-shop
2. Request early refills
3. Sell my medication
4. Seek medication from others
5. Take any illegal drugs

I rely on these medications to remain productive in a highly stressful job while adequately managing my pain.

For this, in the past two years, I have been subjected to pain contracts, pill counts, expensive urinanalysis, and constant questioning from pharmacists.

Like the CDC, if you suggest limits on pain medications it is a given that private insurers and physicians will follow suit. As with the CMS guidelines, I have personally seen suffering for no reason. I have seen patients dropped by physicians who are afraid of being targeted by CMS or the DEA. 

Further, the proposed regulations are not supported by science. First, a major study in the British Medical Journal found that diagnoses of opioid abuse disorder were tracked for 565,000 opioid-nave post-surgical patients between 2008 and 2016. Only 0.6% were later diagnosed with Opioid Abuse Disorder (OAD).  Less than 1% renewed their prescriptions up to 13 weeks.  OAD incidence was only weakly sensitive to dose level from less than 20 to over 120  MME  per day.   

Another large study in JAMA Internal Medicine shows the incidence of extended post-surgical opioid prescriptions at just 0.174% to 0.9%, depending on the type of surgery.

In January 2018 public hearings before the FDA Opioid Policy Steering Committee, the American Academy of Pain Management recommended against hard limits on opioid analgesics.  Other speakers advocated for leaving practice standards to medical professional associations which guide doctors in each specialty.  You seem to have ignored both recommendations.

There is no one-size-fits-all patient or treatment plan.  I beg you to stop attempting to force restrictions on medical practice which have predictable and horrid consequences.  Are you aware that dying cancer patients are beginning to have difficulty obtaining the high-dose pain medications they need to die without excruciating pain? It's called unintended consequences.

Let law enforcement attack the real problem - illicit fentanyl, heroin, and other dangerous illegal drugs from entering the US. That's the real crisis. Not pain medications. Even the CDC has changed its stance and admitted as such.

Thank you for letting me comment,

"593","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient  I suffer from degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia, and other related problems that cause me to be in pain each and every day.

The plans to change the way pain medications are distributed to chronic pain patients will harm me a great deal. Right now I am not able to do a whole lot but if you take away my medication my life will not be worth living. It's very hard to accomplish anything when I am in a great deal of pain. Pain that radiates from my lower back into my hips and down my left leg. Pain medication allows me to do the every day tasks such as cooking and doing my laundry. How am I suppose to accomplish every day self care? Will Medicare give me in home care since I'll be too miserable to do anything?

If Medicare stops paying for my needed medication I will not be able to afford to pay for them. I am on Social Security Disability for the rest of my life, not by choice. I don't make very much money but too much for anyone to help with medication costs although from what I understand about the rules that might be implemented I don't know anyone who could help me. 

People on Opioids as part of their chronic pain therapy are not the cause of the 'opioid crisis' which should be called the 'illegal drug crisis.' I do not sell my medications or give them away, I NEED them. So far I have yet to see a study that shows chronic pain patients as the cause of any of the drug problems. We rely on them to have a life, why would we sell our medications?

So right now if you stop allowing pain patients their need for medications it will cause a great deal of issues and problems for chronic pain patients. I know I'll be in the emergency room quite often to beg them to stop the pain by any means possible. Just put me to sleep because I know there are very few emergency rooms that will give medication to stop pain. I can understand why people will be committing suicide, it's already happening as pain patients are not given pain medications.

Would you stop cancer treatments for cancer patients? No medicine for asthma? I and many others are Chronic Pain Patients, keeping our medications from us is morally wrong. Before voting on this each of you voting should be given the amount of pain that an average person chronic pain patient has for a week without medicine. Then tell me how you would vote.

FEDERAL REGISTER DOCKET NUMBER
CMS-2017-0163

I am a severe chronic pain patient and if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is successful in putting this regulation into effect, I and many other pain patients in my situation will be severely affected.  In my case, I require opioid pain medications to manage a severe intractable pain condition caused by a serious incurable illness.  I have the following diagnoses: Post-Viral Encephalopathy/Neuropathy, Central Pain Syndrome, Arthritis/Degenerative Spine, Constant Headache, Myofascial Pain Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia.  I also have a CYP2D6 genetic anomaly that makes me a very poor metabolizer of many medications, causing me to require a high dose of opioids to effectively control my constant, very severe pain.  My dose is around 2500 MME of Oxycontin and Oxycodone IR and I take approximately 30 pills a day. 
 
The benefits that I receive from my medication far outweigh the risks.  I am almost 68 years old and have been using high-dose opioids for seven plus years with no escalation of dose and my quality of life is vastly improved.  I began suffering pain as a child but the pain gradually increased to the point of being house-bound by the time I was in my late forties and bed-bound by my early fifties.  I was treated by many doctors over the years and I have tried virtually every treatment possible but nothing worked until I became a high-dose patient around age sixty.  I can now do things I had not been able to do in many years such as take care of my lawn, limbing trees, and light household chores and repairs.  I am learning to play guitar, playing a keyboard, and studying music theory; things I could not do before due to concentration issues.  I am more than willing to accept any risk involved for the benefits I receive.  These decisions should be made between a patient and his/her doctor, not the government.  Government does not have a license to practice medicine and I resent their intrusion into my medical care.  Why must you punish me (and many other people) that suffer from terrible diseases that cause excruciating pain, because of abuse problems?  There has to be a better way.  In summary, pain is controllable, and I strongly believe it is a basic human right for people to experience as little pain as possible. This is also the belief of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN).  An optimal living state can be achieved through collaboration between physicians and patients and a personalized treatment of pain can improve patient quality of life, relieve pain, and help prolong patient survival. In addition, a one-size fits all dosing regimen would cause many people's lives to be destroyed after having had a high quality of life. If I am forced to taper from my current dose to 90 mg MME I strongly believe that death would be the result.  My pain level would shoot up and off the charts which would cause me and my cohort to have increased blood pressure and pulse rate.  This, in turn, would cause heart failure and strokes, and then death.  Is this the government's plan?  Killing off the sick and elderly would certainly ease the financial burden on the government.  The blood will be on your hands!  How do you sleep at night?

This NS told everyone that I was just a drug seeker...so no one would look at the 5 MRI's I had that showed the tumor was refilling & that tissue in the right temporal & frontal lobes were dying.

Re:  Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2019 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter

Hello,
My name is Toni Duffy, and I am the daughter of a chronic pain patient covered by Medicare and Medicaid.  In addition to arthritis, fibromyalgia and other painful conditions, my mother suffers from severe interstitial cystitis, a chronic, idiopathic and excruciating disease of the urinary bladder.  She has been treated with oral medications (i.e. Elmiron, antidepressants, NSAIDs), an Interstim implanted device, 12 weekly DMSO instillations, intravenous lidocaine, and botox injections in the bladder.  Many of these treatments were invasive, and caused side effects, in some cases permanent, with little to no benefit.  She has tried diet modification and meditation.  For the last 15 years, she has undergone a hydrodistention every few months in order to stretch the bladder, which provides a very slight, temporary measure of relief.  Chronic pain affects every aspect of her life.  The only thing that has given her some quality of life has been oral pain medications.  These medications allow her to make dinner for her family, which is something in which she takes great pride.  They allow her to hold a conversation, to wrap a birthday gift, to handle her household responsibilities.  They allow her to get out of bed in the morning.  These medications do not remove the pain, but they make the pain tolerable and restore her functioning.  If medical science would discover an effective treatment, my mother's first choice would be to treat her underlying conditions so that she would not need pain medication. This has been demonstrated by her willingness to submit to the treatments listed above, all of which have been unsuccessful and some of which have caused permanent side effects.  An effective treatment for severe interstitial cystitis remains a huge unmet medical need.  Medical science's failure is not her fault.  The issue of opioid addiction has nothing to do with her, and is not her fault.  Her pain is not her fault.  
My mother's current pain care regimen, which is managed through her pain clinic, is at about 90 MME/day.  She has an excellent relationship with her pain clinic physician, based on mutual partnership, respect and trust.  If her need for medication increases, and if she and her physician decide that an increase in MME/day is what is needed to keep her out of agony, this change would create a barrier for her.  She already struggles with hurdles on a daily basis, and has for two decades.  Please do not make her life more difficult than it already is.  My mother is on a fixed income.  If Medicare refuses to pay for her medication, she will suffer and my family will suffer.  The environment in which my mother lives is extremely precarious.  During acute episodes, she has often been left in inescapable, protracted agony by doctors who under-treat her pain because, in their words ""I have to protect my license"".  The pain clinic where she receives her life preserving treatment is at the end of a very long road of physicians who have been afraid or otherwise unwilling to prescribe appropriate pain medication.  She recently revealed to me the fact that, before arriving at this clinic, she was fearful that she would be forced to commit suicide.  This is a woman who loves life, and loves her family.  She felt she could no longer withstand being in agony for months on end.  Please allow my mother to get the treatment she needs, in partnership with her physician without creating yet another barrier for her.  She has already suffered more than what any person should have to endure.  Please reconsider this policy change and the effect it will have on chronic pain patients and their families.   
Sincerely, 
Toni M. Duffy

Your proposed ""guidelines"" would leave me no other choice than suicide, and many of my friends and family with chronic pain conditions have informed me they are in the same situation.

These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.

"616","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"There are millions of chronic pain patients who are able to live a normal life for a few hours a day thanks to the opioid medications which they have been receiving for years. These nedications are written at a strength which is designed to give each patient the best quality of life possible considering the extreme level of their pain which at the very least can be described as agonizing. I am one of those patients.

We do not OD because most of us are under medicated already. The OD's which are so often spoken of by those who are trying to create an Opioid Crisies where there is none in the prescription pain meds arena are coming from sfreet sales of fentanyl which have nothing to do with prescription meds or the strength our doctors prescribe to meet our individual goals of maintaining some activity and quality of life.

If you feel that senior citizens do not deserve any quality of life, and that all we should do is be bedridden in agony which will kill us in very short order from heart attacks, strokes, and major organ system failure due to untreated pain the you should vote for the restrictions on pain meds. Even after you have succeeded in killing off the senior citizen pain patient population you will find that the OD's which result in death for younger Americans will skyrocket because they never had anything to do with prescription medications to begin with. The vast majority of OD's are caused by street drugs such as fentanyl which are of unknown strength because they are not regulated.

Don't let the DEA's failure to control illegal drug sales become an excuse to destroy the lives of millions of Americans who were stable and able to have some quality of life through the palliative care they received from their doctors which relied upon opioids which have been used to safely and reliably combat pain for thousands of years. Prescription drugs are not the problem. Do not restrict them and drive millions of Americans into the street making drug cartels and funeral homes all the more properous.

"617","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I oppose this petition and believe the FDA should as well. I am an Intractable Pain Patient of 19 years. Diagnosis: CRPS/READ, which is sometimes referred to as the Suicide disease because it is the highest rated pain on the McGill Pain Index. I suffered a crush injury to both legs and feet resulting in excruciating agony from severe destruction of my nerves from the knees down.The pain is indescribable, the best way I can explain it is that someone poured acid on both legs and feet. My legs were going to be amputated, but a physician who knew my family intervened, leaving me in braces.

I rely on high dose oipioids to manage my incurable pain. I went from being bed-ridden to now leading a productive life. I take care of my 90 yr old mother who has dementia, and am able to drive and shop, doing most of the things I had done before. I have been on and tried everything: yoga, bio-feedback, NSAID'S and Motrin (which cause liver/kidney damage and transplants), SSI's, Trazadone, nerve blocks, injections, even a failed spinal cord stimulator operation.

When the spinal cord stimulator failed, my neurologist forgot to prescribe my oipioid meds and legs/feet felt like Joan of Arc burning at the stake. I couldn't speak, with waves of nausea when I moved. I have been stabilized on 150 mcg. of Fentanyl patches every 48 hours, with no increase in dose for 19 years. I'm in constant contact with the Chronic Pain Patients (CPP'S), and no one I know, including me, have ever gotten a ""high"" from our pain meds. We are NOT addicted, we are dependent, big difference. When you have moderate to severe pain, the pain receptors in your brain absorb the medication. Addiction happens when the pain disappears and you keep taking the painkillers!

Less than 1% of pain patients who take their meds responsibility become addicted, according to the Cochrane Report. I am a model patient, use 1 Dr., 1 pharmacy, do not smoke or drink. My medication is locked and I have a Pre-authorized, Quantity Dose Limit so there is no leftover medication.

The proposed regulations are Not science based. The 90 MME cut-off and current oipioid phobia has forced CPP'S to make 2 choices: 1) Suicide (which is outpacing OD deaths, but is not identified as such), an/or 2) Turning to illegal drugs (heroin, China White coming across the border and through the Post Office), which you say you are trying to fight against. The War On Drugs has become The War On Pain Patients!

One of the co-authors of the CDC'S 2016 Guidelines for prescribing oipioids is a psychiatrist who has no training in pain or pain management and owns a big addiction treatment center. He says oipioids are all ""little heroin"" pills which make an addict of anyone who takes them, and are ""useless"" in treating pain. If that is true, why do they give them to cancer patients? He has a definite conflict of interest, and misconstrues/manipulates the statistics for his own agenda. The other co-sponsor of the Guidelines is an anesthesiologist who says "" Life is full of pain, and people should suck it up and not focus on the intensity of pain."" This person obviously, has a disconnect in understanding the minute by minute, day by day, year after year unrelenting pain with no end in sight.

The effect of the Guidelines have had a huge, chilling result in the medical community. The DEA is going after Physicians, suing them, taking away their licenses, and jailing them sometimes for decades. They won't write a script, and even if you got one, the Pharmacist/Pharmacy can and often does, ovveride it saying ""I don't feel comfortable filling your script OR I'm out of stock."" Since the DEA is reducing the manufacturing 3 years in a, that may be true. Now, the insurance companies won't insure them. 

Untreated Pain is it's own disease, causing heart attacks, strokes and brain damage (dementia). The government needs to get out of health care. If these policies become law/regulation: they would force every Dr. to stop treating pain and put the 120 million Chronic Pain Patients onto Disability, Medicaid and every social service program out there. ER's will be maxxed out. CPP'S will have to have expensive surgeries which could put them at risk for death or further damage and disability.

Everyone is just an accident, disease or disorder away from joining the Chronic Pain Community.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0720","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-IL"

"619","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The US opioid epidemic has changed profoundly in the last 3 years, in ways that require substantial
recalibration of the US policy response.  
Heroin and fentanyl have come to dominate an escalating epidemic of lethal opioid overdose, whereas opioids
commonly obtained by prescription play a minor role, accounting for no more than 15% of reported
deaths in 2015.  The observed changes in the
opioid epidemic are particularly remarkable because they have emerged despite sustained reductions in
opioid prescribing and sustained reductions in prescription opioid misuse. Among US adults, past-year
prescription opioid misuse is at its lowest level since 2002. A credible epidemiologic account of the opioid epidemic is as follows: although opioid prescribing by physicians appears to have unleashed the epidemic prior to 2012, physician prescribing  no longer plays a major role in sustaining it. The accelerating pace of the opioid epidemic in 2015-2016
requires a serious reconsideration of governmental policy initiatives that continue to focus on reductions
in opioid prescribing. The dominant priority should be the assurance of subsidized access to evidencebased
medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Such treatment is lacking across much of the
United States at this time. Further aggressive focus on prescription reduction is likely to obtain
diminishing returns while creating significant risks for patients.

Following this same logic, it is NOT LOGICAL TO INSTITUTE THIS POS hard edit at the pharmacy.

Many treatments have been offered, tried and failed, steroids were a temporary miracle until they shut down her kidneys, miracle over. Her only option has been a steady treatment of opioids.  It has allowed her to work, pay taxes and live a fairly independent life.  She lives in terror that her pain relief will be cut or illuminated forcing her to actually consider suicide.  The biggest brains in the world are working on a cure, or at least a non-narcotic treatment for her disease, in the meantime, her only recourse are opioids.

She is monitored by a number of doctors and clinics - only to have several of them close down because of the increased pressure from politicians and state pressure.  She is not a drug seeker, addict, recreational user - she is drug tested randomly for ANY drug that should not be in her system. If she fails, she is off her pain contract - she knows it, accepts it and protects it.

If these laws continue, she and others like her will die.  Go after the addicts, codependent medical facilities that break the rules, renegade doctors.  Stop allowing these people to hijack our culture and the most fragile members of our society.

I see politicians (Chris Christie) on TV slobbering to addicts ""help is available"" -addicts count and chronic pain patients don't.

"624","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Im a disabled chronic pain patient who is deteriorating very fast. I don't know how long I will live but my opiate medication helps keep me alive. It helps me cope with the unrelenting pain. Gabapentin helps calm the nerve signals to the brain and due to trauma and generalized anxiety disorder; I also take klonopin for severe panic. My blood pressure goes from a resting rate of 90/82 to 157/110 during a panic attack!  As you can imagine these medications are a lifeline for me. 

There's so many problems with limiting these medications to those of us on medicare or medicaid [if you are injured/disabled you are on state medical before Federal.] Including increased risk of heart attacks, increased risk of suicide, increased costs for hospital visits to the ER as we are left with no recourse and even now we are stigmatized in the ER. Don't force us in there more. These measures also increase the need for surgeries. All cost more and can cost more lives than what is attempted to be saved. 

Until we understand pain and have better ways to treat it. Access to alternative medications and treatments which are not currently covered by our plans; until we have better methods please do not take away what holds so many of us together.

 There's a good reason these medications are seen together. Gabapentin works on neuropathic pain, aids in sleep and some anxiety - baseline anxiety/nerve signals to brain. Opiates which help the brain cope with these excessive pain signals for physical problems visible on any diagnostic tool from MRI to Xray as well as pain without a clear cause - the cause can show later. Opiates help with fatigue, they allow me to shower, to change my clothes, do laundry and do more than sit in a bathtub and recliner [I just went through it, September 2017 until issue fixed with doctor].

 While, klonopin helps ease those signals when they flare; in my case as my nerves not only raise blood pressure, heart rate but cause me to break out in shingles after a busy, anxious week; despite my medications - except my opiates have already been reduced too much, and these limits have caused me to start wasting disease. No other cause besides pain. CRPS left side. Suffering for 18 years now!  

Please do not hurt me or millions others like me, further, please understand we are sick even if the chronic pain issue isn't traditionally terminal; we are sick, we die younger than others and when we do we have our medications in our system. That's not an overdose. That's a natural death by illness. Don't help dig our grave faster!

"625","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a current chronic pain patient who has been successfully taking opioids for over 5 years. This is not something I seek or desire - it is necessary to maintain both quality of life and physical and mental function. I have Ehlers-Danlos. On opioids, I have finished my Bachelor's degree and completed my Master's degree in Nursing - both maintaining a 4.0 grade average. During the past year, due to my insurance following any recommendations made to CMS, my medication is no longer covered since I am over the magic ""90MME"" limit. Now, my co-pay has quadrupled. All while I am beginning repayment of my student loans. The stress that comes with a chronic, disabling condition, the stigma that the government has placed on chronic pain patients, and maintaining full-time employment is just nearly more than I can tolerate. Meanwhile- if I were a heroin user, my use patterns will not be touched by this legislation! How is it that the so-called ""statistics"" show SO many dying, yet not one member of any of my support groups even appear altered (let alone have died of overdose)? My degree is in Nursing Informatics - which is heavily founded in statistical analysis. The methods used for CMS/CDC statistical definition of ""opioid user"" is convoluted so far beyond normal statistical tolerances allow that it has failed to focus on the problem - the access and availability of heroin and illegal or counterfeit Fentanyl in this country. Your legislation would do nothing more than. increase overdose deaths by forcing compliant, functioning chronic pain patients to the street AND increase the deaths related to suicide. Many people I have had the pleasure of knowing have ended their life due to the simple fact they are too tired to fight anymore with Ehlers-Danlos, and their forced tapering of their opioid use was more than they could face. How is this effective? How does your proposed legislation promise any improvement on opioid overdose deaths when heroin is included in your statistics? Is it simply because the prescribed opioids are the only opioid you can control? That is not my fault. Nor is it the fault of all chronic pain patients who endure monthly urine screens, pill counts, and stigma. We already prove compliance every month to our prescribing physician. What do the heroin users have to prove?

Until CMS admits that the statistics are erroneous because the sample is not valid, until an adequate sample of established chronic pain patients is evaluated for overdose statistics - nothing you legislate will address the problem. Opioid prescriptions are at an all-time low. Overdoses are (reportedly) at an all-time high. Doesn't this make it blatantly evident that those who were using legal prescriptions and no longer have those prescriptions are turning elsewhere for relief? Heroin or Fentanyl dealers on the streets don't make you provide a urine sample. They don't require you to show you didn't use too much last month. They give freely - and this legislation does nothing more than provide the street dealers with an ENTIRE new demographic of clientele. 

CMS Quality Reporting metrics for IQR/OQR reporting have very specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for measures. Why this same strict mechanism is not used for the inclusion and exclusion of data for opioid overdose statistics prior to passing legislation? And... when your legislation could endanger so many who are already disadvantaged and vulnerable. Mechanisms already exist to remove the license of physicians who are not responsible prescribers. Medicare's job is to trust the prescriber to provide the most effective treatment for their patient after a thorough assessment. It is NOT the function of CMS to remove the patient assessment from the provider AND put the burden of those who are already abusing illegal drugs onto their patients. That is offensive to me, and it is bordering practicing medicine at the system level. That has proven to be a failed method in every aspect of medicine. Sadly, the only ones who will pay for that failure are myself and those like me who are already trying to take their chronic illness one day at a time. Please, I sincerely request you delay your recommendations and legislation until such time that am accurate statistical representation of those you will be affecting is evaluated.

I was forced to give them both up when my condition worsened.  I am now on disability.  I've been denied pain medicine, asked to leave a practice because I needed surgery, had my BEST dr arrested to set an example to the other dr's and even had to develop a spreadsheet to find a new pain dr because no one would take on a patient who could only be medically managed

A lot of the statistics being used have been falsified in order to make things look worse than they really are.  The panels and groups put together did not include Chronic Pain Patients, Pharmacists, Pain Mgmt Dr's, Veterans or anyone who is DIRECTLY connected to ongoing life changing chronic pain.  Unless you experience it you cannot understand it.  Put rocks in your shoes, walk a lot, live in them.  Tape a tennis ball to your lower back, your neck and your mid back.  Leave them and the rocks in place for three days thus putting yourself in constant pain and unable to sleep properly.  See how well you function due to the pain.  I think you will become more understanding.  

You need to call it what it is, the 'illegal Opioid epidemic' thus separating the two TOTALLY different groups.  The ones who take Opioids as prescribed, pass their random pee tests, see their Dr's on a regular basis vs the ones who fail their pee tests, don't see their Dr and are obviously abusing the system and need to be arrested.  The REAL epidemic is with Heroin (which does not have a tie in from long term properly prescribed Opioid use), Crack, Cocaine, Spice, Fentanyl and I could go on.  Do not lump us and call us 'addicts' when we are not. 

It has already been shown that taking Opioid medication from us has caused the Heroin arrest rate and the suicide rate to skyrocket, look at Maine.  They ended up amending their policy due to it.  It will continue to do so.  More people will be unable to work leading to disability payments, food stamps, Sec 8 housing, etc...  PLEASE PLEASE think this through to the end result.  Do your research, do not just jump at the easy answer.  Addicts will always be addicts, it used to be PCP, then Cocaine, Crack, huffing, Spice, now Heroin and Fentanyl.  They will ALWAYS find a way.  PLEASE stop punishing us for their mistakes!  

As Chronic Pain Patients we have tried EVERYTHING before we would agree to take Opioid medications with their financial cost, side effects and the stigma.  This is not a decision we would take lightly.  There are numerous diseases out there for which there are no treatment, no way to make things better other than pain medication.  Take it away and we are unable to function, we cannot clean our homes, do our laundry or shopping and some can barely make it from the bed to the bathroom.  That is NO kind of life which is why the suicide rate has increased so dramatically.

The fact that there are Veterans who have served our country, are returning horribly injured and are now being denied pain meds is unconscionable let alone cruel.  There are published articles that back up my statements in the NEJM, The National Pain Report, STAT and even the DEA, FDA and CDC themselves.  We already have tracking methods in place from the Dr's to the patients on down to the pharmacists and pharmacies.  Please THOROUGHLY research everything and include the people who will be impacted before you make any decisions.

No long term studies have been done proving or disproving the addiction theory.  The CDC refused to accept the info given them based on it's being short term.  Before we do anything more we need long term studies done by unbiased ppl.

Sometimes I have to go to 10 pharmacies to get my meds because they are out and they won't fill them until the day I RUN out so it's either shop around or do w/out.  What do ppl who don't have cars do?  Then some pharmacists prejudge you and refuse a valid script.  The reduction in manuf of Opioids is making it EXTREMELY diff to obtain our needed meds.  PLEASE don't make it more diff for us.  Look back in time, tobacco (#1 killer) was vilified and a lot done to stop it and while it costs us billions yearly and more deaths (inc 2nd hand smoke) than Opioids it's still sold easily.  Alcohol (#2 killer) also causes more deaths and injuries yet there is a TV show about moonshiners!  It is also sold easily.  The prob is the addicts.  We need more rehabs, counselors, etc..  You are punishing all for the sins of a few.  You just CANNOT understand what it's like living in pain ALL the time, barely able to function, only to have it taken away or forcibly reduced to the point you don't want to live.  ALL the decisions are being made by ppl affected by addiction somehow, that is not right.  Where is the fairness?  PLEASE PLEASE don't make any more chgs until some studies have been done.

I will be happy to speak with anyone.

""Use of Opioids at High Dosage in Persons without Cancer (OHD): The proportion
(XX out of 1,000) of individuals from the denominator receiving prescriptions for opioids with
a daily dosage greater than 120 mg morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for 90 consecutive
days or longer. ""

On September 10, 2013 the FDA responded to a petition presented by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP) that its requests were rejected in part on several important pieces pertaining to this change:

1) add a maximum daily dose, equivalent to 100 milligrams of morphine for non-cancer pain and 
2) add a maximum duration of 90-days for continuous daily use for non-cancer pain

The FDA specifically states:

""It is FDA's view that a patient without cancer, like a patient with cancer, may suffer from chronic pain, and PROP has not provided scientific support for why labeling should recommend different treatment for such patients"".

The same should hold true here as well. Pain is not a readily externally quantifiable measurement that can be reasonably conveyed by any available mechanism. The differentiation between cancer and non-cancer pain has no scientific basis.

Regarding the maximum duration/dose, the FDA states that:

""FDA agrees that adverse events and substance abuse of opioids occur at high doess - but adverse events can also occur at doses less than 100mg MED. FDA also acknowledges that the available data do suggest a relationship between increasing opioid dose and risk of certain adverse events. However, the available information does not demonstrate that the relationship is necessarily a causal one.""

Full letter available here: https://www.seattle.gov/documents/departments/cityAttorney/opioidLitigation/FDA-ResponsePROPpetition.pdf

In addition, regarding the possible substance abuse due to higher dose usage, there is similarly no available scientific evidence to support this.

Postsurgical prescriptions for opioid naive patients and association with overdose and misuse: retrospective cohort study BMJ 2018;360:j5790

States that ""duration of the prescription rather than dosage is more strongly associated with ultimate misuse in the early postsurgical period"". Keeping in mind that the total abuse found in this survey of 1,000,000+ opioid naive patients was approximately 0.6% (minus a possible overlap of dependent, but not addicted patients, due to ICD9 coding ambiguities)

http://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5790

In summary, there does not seem to be any scientific support for either the non-cancer limitation or the daily MME as stated. There have already been severe limitations on legitimate opioid users and this will only further the obstacles that they face in their effort to maintain some semblance of a reasonable quality of life.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0166","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-27T00:00:00-05:00","Chris Remshaw-TX"

I am on the end of the chronic pain disease epidemic.   As the CDC, DEA and Medicaid and medicare,  and numerous other government associates, are blaming Doctors for the over prescribing of medication,  NOBODY, is looking at or reading the statistics from chronic pain disease patients.   How about not addressing these drugs as dangerous and addictive.  Let's look at them as lifesaving and medically necessary for the million of Americans in chronic pain.  Chronic pain is a disease.   It is now becoming an epidemic. 
No other disease medication is scrutinized.  Chronic pain is a disease.   We as patients are being denied,  dismissed and overlooked by our drs due to all the scrutiny associated with treating chronic pain disease.   Our doctors are afraid to treat us adequately.   We have a disease that medication is readily accessible to us and we are being denied.   We pain patients are truly being discriminated against, due to people who use heroin,  illegal fentanyl,  and placed a blame on anyone but themselves.   This is a witch hunt for drs who prescribe life saving medication and pain disease patients who benefit from this medication.  
We have a chronic disease.  We want to be able to take care of our homes, our children,  our selves, as much as possible,  but without access to our, potentially, life saving medications,  we are unable to do so.  We want to live not just exist in pain 24/7.  
We need the government agencies to look at the real statistics, not the hand picked.
We need help.  With all the headlines, topics and stories on how opioids are bad, let's look at what good they do for our disease of chronic pain and the million of Americans they help.

The war on drugs has never met with any success. The DEA needs to concentrate on drug lords who flood the market for huge profits.

Instead the DEA is harassing doctors dedicated to helping their patients and pharmacists trying to do their jobs. The testimonials I hear are earth-shattering, mind-boggling and beyond belief.

The government need not be in the business of a private relationship between doctor and patient. The government counts numbers without having any understanding of the relationship between the two which is confidential and not subject to government scrutiny. 

The least strong rather innocuous pain med is Norco, which is legal to legitimate patients in a Doctor-patient setting. Norco is being grouped with heroin!! The term opioids is beyond credible. Heroin is highly addictive, has hideous withdrawal, and is totally illegal. It is used to get high typically  unlike a pain med. 

It is easy to overdose and die from heroin. There is a black market for heroin and there has always been one. Now it is readily available, inexpensive and pain patients who can no longer access their pain meds are turning to heroin to fight off the pain that is intolerable. Crime is associated with heroin and it destroys lives. The ""cure'"" methadone is more addictive than the heroin!

There is no comparison between a pain med like Norco and heroin!

Norco is a pain killer as it kills pain. I take it under my doctor's guidance and I have done so for years. This med is a part of a plan for treatment. There was a lapse of three years when I took no Norco, or any pain med, as my pain was in remission.

I have Trigeminal neuralgia type 2: there is no cure. I've had the excruciating nerve damage for 23 years that has been so painful it has knocked me to the floor.

When there is a lapse of pain med, I curl up in a ball, wishing I were dead- the pain is that bad. I can't eat. I can't socialize. I am utterly useless. Trigeminal neuralgia is the most painful disease known to mankind.

The pain has been significantly more severe upon occasion, and I have been prescribed by my doctor stronger pain medication with no problems.

It's worth noting that I had breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy and the cancer was quite aggressive so I received many radiation treatments. Being light skinned, I was in severe pain from the radiation. I slept for twelve hours a day. My skin was not recognizable- I was burnt to a crisp red, purple, black, blue, peeling, oozing (not to gross you out).

After I had a good half of my breast lopped off, I had to fight to get a standard dose of Vicodin. The radiologist refused to give me something stronger during radiation- most of the time I was still working. He couldn't even recommend a better cream for my skin. How I suffered.

So much for treating cancer patients especially well.

I have read that they propose  Lyrica be treated as a potentiator. I take Lyrica which is a safe medication which can help the pain but in no way gets you light-headed even.

I have taken the round of anti-seizure medication. Some of these are very heavy duty drugs. Neurontin, for example, had me crawling to the bathroom. Tegretol, before I got use to it, had me bouncing off the wall. I take an anti-epileptic now which I tolerate well. 

I taught as a primary bilingual teacher for twenty five years. I estimate I taught a thousand kids to read. I loved teaching. I taught until I was ready to drop. 

,Trigeminal neuralgia destroyed my life and I shudder at the prospect of there come a day, I'll be unable to have my pain treated because of governmental politics and interference with my relationship with my doctor and I !

"635","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I live with a chronic pain sufferer and I have seen first hand how the CDC guidelines (intended for Primary Care Physicians) have negatively impacted his life. After multiple failed and/or botched surgeries and one almost resulting in his death, the only relief he gets is from his high dose of opioid medications.

He is a patient with the same  Pain Management clinic in north Atlanta for the past 8 years and prior to that with pain management pain specialists in Cincinnati. He has  complied with the rules included in the contract he signed with the clinics, including mandatory visits every 3 months, random urine drug testing and pill counts.He has done everything asked of him by his pain management doctors, including undergoing numerous invasive procedures in an attempt to find an alternative to alleviate his chronic pain. But no other alternative has been successful in helping alleviate his chronic pain. How much should one have to endure???

He has been on a dosage of opioid medications above the 90 or 120 MME for over 18 years and has been able to have a manageable life on this regimen. However, as of early 2017, his pain medications were cut by more than half due to the CDC guidelines and physicians intimidation by the Federal government to comply. This abrupt adjustment in his pain medication caused weeks of excruciating pain and medication withdrawal. He now lives in more pain than he has in 20 years. He is unable to perform daily tasks that non-chronic pain people take for granted without ending up bed ridden for 2 days or more.He describes his pain as if he is being hit by a baseball bat all over his body.

Since the reduction of his pain medication, his life has deteriorated to the point that he cannot perform the most basic of daily tasks without severe debilitating consequences.Of course, living in this much constant pain also affects your state of mind and leads to more depression. 

Nobody should have to live (exist) in that much pain when there is medication that would allow them to function at a higher level.

Chronic pain sufferers are being discriminated against with the implementation of a maximum daily MME of their pain medications. Every person is different and what may be effective for one person will not work for all.There are enough regulations in place for legitimate Pain Management physicians to treat their patients as they deem is appropriate. 

Unfortunately, the majority of people suffering with chronic pain are on disability which means they have Medicare. With CMS wanting to regulate/enforce what physicians can and cannot do to treat their patients, there is real harm being done to the very patients that need these life saving medications (opioids). These patients also do not have the ability to fight for their rights, (the right to the medical care they need) due to their excruciating levels of pain.

The government needs to do the right thing and allow pain management specialists to treat their patients without interference ,after all they are the doctors and they know their patients. What was once a sacred trust between a doctor and patient is no longer the case. Physicians and pharmacists are being bullied by the government to NOT treat their patients with the medical care they need and deserve.

Please do not abandon these people that need help the most and are unable to stand up for themselves!!!! They depend on these opioid medications to LIVE!!

It breaks my heart to know that there is medication that will allow him to live a better life, but because of these regulations, he is in so much more pain than anyone should have to ""live"" with. He is only 58 years old and now wondering how much longer he can suffer like this. What should I tell him???? 

I really hope someone actually reads these ""comments"" from actual chronic pain HUMANS and or their loved ones! How can our government turn their backs on these people???

"636","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am writing this in regards to CMS-2017-0613-007.  I intensely encourage CMS to recognize adult day services as one of the expanded health-related supplemental benefits to be included in Medicare Advantage Plans during the bidding process.

Adult Day Services info:
	People living with chronic conditions and diseases such as hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental illness, Alzheimer's, dementia, developmental disability, or traumatic brain injury need better access to adult day centers to receive the care they need to continue to live in their own homes and avoid the high costs of institutionalization.

	During the past half-century, Medicare services have been expanded but the system itself has not been modernized to accommodate less expensive delivery of services to consumers with chronic diseases. Adult Day Health Centers (ADHC) provide quality, cost-effective nursing services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work services. NADSA encourages Congress and CMS to infuse health care funding with consumer choice for more cost-effective home and community-based services through an ADHC.  Offering rehabilitation through an ADHC to individuals discharged from acute care institutions rather than re-institutionalizing them in a nursing home is more cost effective and more therapeutic. Legislation has been introduced in multiple sessions to provide ADHC services as an option to institutional care.

	Adult Day Services provide medical oversite to monitor health to watch for changes or concerns, manage and care for medical care and ensure medication, nutrition and general health remain stable.

	Today, families are being sent home to care for their loved ones after being released from the hospital, ADS have nurses on staff that can assist with this care and allow families to keep working.  The nurses can monitor an individual's health and can report any changes immediately to help prevent or shorten hospital stays.

	Often it is an elderly spouse or a child that takes over the care for this individual, with little to no medical knowledge.  By reducing the level of care needed, the state saves money on health costs as well as keep individuals with their families and active in the community.

 Medicaid is the payer of last resort and pays nearly 2.5 times more per-person for nursing home care than for ADS in lieu of nursing home care.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my comments on CMS-2017-0163-0007.   I strongly encourage CMS to recognize and to emphasize adult day services as one of the expanded health-related supplemental benefits to be included in Medicare Advantage Plans during the bidding process.  Let's give our citizens the best quality care at the least cost.

Attachment II Section L. Normalization Factors

We appreciate that CMS has requested input on the selection of FFS Normalization factors for the 2019 payment year. In our review of the proposed factor development, we are concerned that the proposed method might not account for the fixed effects of ICD-10 implementation on FFS risk scores in 2016 and 2017. Specifically, we are concerned that the rate of excess growth in risk scores from 2015 to 2017 will not persist from 2017 to 2019. We propose instead that CMS use data from 2012-2015 FFS risk scores to estimate the slope, and to use 2017, rather than 2015, FFS scores as a jumping off point for projecting 2019 FFS risk scores. This approach will ensure that projected 2019 risk scores are greater than 2017 risk scores, while removing the singular influence of the ICD-10 transition from the slope estimates. We propose this approach for all six risk models.

2019 Star Ratings Program and the Categorical Adjustment Index
CMS has stated that CAI is not meant to be punitive. We recommend that there should be a hold harmless provision for any plan that would reach 4 Stars without the CAI.

MPF Price Accuracy:
We are supportive of this remaining a display measure for 2020 and adding to 2022 Star Ratings.

High Risk Medications
We are supportive of High Risk Medications remaining a display measure for 2019. We propose that HRM remain on display for at least 2 years with advance notice prior to adding to Star Ratings. When HRM is moved from Display to Star Ratings, we propose starting as a single-weighted measure before moving to a triple-weighted measure.

Opioid Overuse
We would suggest CMS provide direction and materials for provider educati0n along with any further monitoring and metrics, e.g., providers must complete a continuing education program endorsed by CMS. CMS may pilot the education and measure effect with follow-on reporting to assess the utility of further opioid metrics. We suggest CMS consider a minimum overlapping day supply that would indicate concomitant sue and a minimum day supply to indicate chronic use.

PolyPharmacy: 

Use of Multiple Anticholinergic (ACH) Medications in Older Adults (Poly-ACH)
The Polypharmacy ACH measure may be consuming since this measure conveys the message to not take multiple ACH drugs while HRM's message is to not take ACH drugs at all. We propose CMS adopt one or the other. If CMS moves forward with Polypharmacy ACH, we suggest a minimum overlapping day supply to identify concomitant chronic use to avoid members who are switching therapy.

Use of Multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Medications in Older Adults (Poly-CNS)
The Polypharmacy CNS measure may be consuming since this measure conveys the message to not take multiple CNS drugs while HRM's message is to not take CNS drugs at all. We propose CMS adopt one or the other. If CMS moves forward with Polypharmacy CNS, we suggest a minimum overlapping day supply to identify concomitant chronic use to avoid members who are switching therapy.

Due to this infection, I cannot undergo any form of surgery to correct any of these issues. It is too dangerous.
1) In an effort to avoid opioid pain medication, I have tried: prolotherapy, chiropractic, acupressure, acupuncture, reflexology, biofeedback, I.V. chelation therapy, aquatherapy, diathermy, gluten free diet, removal/replacement metal dental fillings, TNS unit, Anxiety Release and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, massage, vitamin shots, organic juicing and Barley Green, Reliv protein supplements, art therapy, stretching, braces, ortho-visc knee injections, arthroscopic surgery (before the staph infection), steroid injections, Voltaren topical gel, lidocaine patches, hydrotherapy, walking. 3 miles daily, tricyclic anti-depressants, physical therapy, Lyrica, Gabapentin, Savella, Horizant, NSAID's (until liver deteriorated and gastritis from cancer medication made that unworkable) and even magnetic mattresses. None of these treatments were sucessful in addressing my debilitating pain, however, opioid medication enabled me to continue taking care of my family, including our adopted daughter with special needs, particularly driving, grocery shopping, laundry, etc. Since my pain medication began being reduced in 2016 due to CDC Guidelines, I am familiar with the affects of a 'one size fits all' reduction which was overseen and implemented by non-pain management officials. As a result, our PM physicians are being dictated to by officials without experience in this field or chronic pain sufferers and, as a consequence, pharmacists and insurance companies have been given permission to practice medicine without a license by being given authority to reject a doctor's prescriptions. My own Pain Management physician was forced to find employment in a different field and all of the four PM Nurse Practitioners at that practice have also found employment in different fields since they have been prohibited from using their best judgement to treat their patients. Untreated or under-treated chronic pain can and does lead to other issues such as BP, cardiac and stroke. The quality of life for these pain sufferers such as myself forces them to quit gainful employment, apply for disability, access ER facilities, which incurs financial repercussions and a one-size-fits-all mentality does not take into consideration the severity of an injury, a person's size and weight, their metabolism or genetics. Every other medical diagnosis takes these protocols into consideration when prescribing medication. Most importantly, true chronic pain patients are NEVER prescribed HEROIN and the Fentanyl available on the streets has been tampered with and combined with other ingredients. Overdoses are known NOT to be a prescribing issue. We pain sufferers are very conservative with our medication since it must last a month and we are not permitted refills or multiple scripts. To force people who are already suffering debilitating pain to visit their Pain Management physicians weekly to obtain their meds, make multiple trips to the pharmacy as well as pay additional copays, particularly if they have no help or easily available transportation causes exhaustion and additional pain, not to mention additional costs. We have never failed urine screens or we would be fired from our PM practice, nor do we mix our medications dangerously with alcohol. It is the drug cartels and the Post Office who are facilitating the availability of illegal heroin and fentanyl for easy access to drug abusers while suffering pain patients, under their physicians oversight and following their directions, who are being punished, while the true culprits become wealthy at our expense. Please consider these comments when making your decisions for next year. My medication, which enabled me to successfully function (with pacing) was reduced, against my doctor's best judgment. It has caused me to become bedridden. I can no longer even attend most family gatherings. Please send a message to our leaders to target the real problem, i.e. the illicit drug market and those involved in it, not legitimate long term pain sufferers.

At 19 I was hit by a car going 40mph and I landed 40' from the car. Since then my spine has slowly deteriorated. I have had 4 lumbar surgeries (one majorly failed and I ended up in a wheelchair, an anterior cervical fusion that did not fuse and 4 other surgeries. I have tried every holistic modality, mindfulness and pain programs, injections and epidurals with no relief and every medication under the sun. I have traumatic arthritis in my neck and in my thoracic spine where I have scoliosis. Add to that Treatment Resistant Depressing and Anxiety and PTSD from all my surgeries. I am currently on a dose of opioids that goes over the ""morphine equivalent"" by a little bit. I need these medications to just to take the edge off to function. It doesn't make me high or doesn't give me total pain relief. I have worked with and been monitored by Pain Doctors the last 15 years. I have taken my medicine as prescribed and take s urinalysis every year. I was forced to go on disability 5 years ago and have been thrown into Medicare. It is near impossible to find doctors who take Medicare and is currently excepting new patients. On top of that the current method to get my opioids every month is time consuming and frustrating. It is like Groundhog Day once a month. I have been on the same amount of opioids for nearly 2 years - no changes. My doctor has to mail scripts to OptumRx, OptumRx usually kick it back to the doctor asking for ""prior authorization"" asking my doctor the same questions over and over again. This takes time. Then OptumRx mails it to me and I have to be home to sign for it. If I'm not home they leave it at the post office for me to pick up. As I am disabled I need someone to drive me as there is never any parking within a short distance I can walk. San Francisco is overcrowded and it's a miracle if you can find parking on the same block as your destination. I have to wait until someone can drive me and drop me at the front of the post office. So more time goes by. I get a 30 day supply every month on the same day that doesn't mean that I will get my meds that day, there is usually some reason for delay. It is not wise to start and stop opioids but I find myself a few days short every month because of the same B.S. required month after month. It is extremely hard to get my meds now the CDC wants to reduce my meds? Why don't you let Doctors that study this be the ones to make that decision based on each patients different makeup and situation? The way this ""opioid epidemic"" is being spread through government and the media, I being over the morphine equivalent should be lying in a gutter drooling nodding out near an OD. Instead I'm a functioning person who can engage in some activities and have somewhat of a quality of life. My life is already filled with difficulties please don't add to it with your restrictions. Please treat true chronic pain patients with dignity and understanding. Leave us in the good hands of our Pain Doctors and go after the real pushers and addicts of black market opioids. I really don't know how I could live my life without medication, there will be a lot of suicidal patients because of your actions. As a side note with each of my surgeries my severe pain was off the chart and with the next surgery I believed that I have already been in unimaginable pain, it can't be worse.

"641","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been a chronic pain sufferer for the past 15 years. The past 12 years, I had received effective pain management through my PCP; in the form of opioids. In that time, I hadn't come up short on pill counts or violated any measures put into place, as far as my use of opioids was concerned. I moved to Indiana a few months ago, and I was promptly removed from my medication and told I couldn't be helped. I suffer from degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, migraines, and now carry the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Since being removed from pain medications, I went from being able to function--still at a lower level--to being nearly nonfunctional, whatsoever. Because of the pain, I lay in bed most of the day and feel like screaming. But, on top of the pain and being removed from access to any effective pain management, I now have extremely high blood pressure--starting immediately after being removed from opioids. Because of this, I can no longer even take NSAIDs; of which weren't very effective, anyway. 

I was in school for social work and substance abuse counseling, so I know what addiction looks like; the vast majority of those on opioids for chronic pain are NOT addicts, but dependant on substances to allow a certain level of functioning. It is not these chronic pain patients that have contributed to the ""opioid crisis,"" but, rather, doctors overprescribing for ACUTE conditions. Trust me, those on opioids for chronic, long-lasting conditions are NOT going to sell, giveaway, or use their medications to the point they no longer have pain relief. Pain becomes who we are, and we do not like it. Our only goal is to ameliorate a life plagued by being nonfunctional from pain. Most of us have run the gamut of treatment options well before we got to the level of opioids, so it's not like we have sought out a treatment that is now frowned upon with disdain, controversy, and viewing those wanting pain relief as addicts. Restricting pain patients will only result in more suicides and ruined lives.

"646","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient with multiple and life-changing diagnoses including, degenerative joint disease (I have no disc in my spine, they have deteriorated and I am bone on bone).
I have lived with this disease for over 20 years of my life. I also have Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritis, Sciatica, Neuropathy, Sjogren's Syndrome, Spinal Stenosis that I live with every day of my life.
I have tried injections, physical therapy, occupational therapy, water therapy, NSAIDs, muscle relaxers, TENS units and many other procedures and non-opioid, treatments however, they have failed to adequately control my pain, so my doctor uses a combination of opioid pain medications along with the non-opioid treatments. 
I am a compliant patient who has had the same healthcare professional for 20+ years who takes care of all my pain care needs. My medications are secured in a home safe that is bolted to the floor. I only use one pharmacy and again it has been the same pharmacy for over 20+ years. I have never lost my opioid pain medications, I have never had them stolen and I have never taken more than what is prescribed to me.
I rely upon opioid medications to give me the ability to function in day to day life. I am still limited but the opioid medications allow me to continue to be able to walk on my own two legs/feet. There was a period of over two years that I was confined to a wheelchair due to the severe pain that I must live with daily. It was using a combination of water therapy and opioids that allowed me to once again walk. 
The opioids allow me to manage my incurable pain, they allow me to remain an active member of my family, where I can enjoy interacting with my grandchildren.
My medical conditions will continue to deteriorate and will continue to decrease my ability to function normally as I go through the aging process 

CMS and the CDC are enacting polices written by non-pain management professionals, without input from the community that will be and is affected the most by these unsupported by science regulations and policies. The people writing these regulations do not understand...nor does it seem that they care to understand how un-treated and under-treated pain affects the whole person ---mind, body and soul. The people that you should be interacting with in regards to new regulations and policies is the true experts...people living with pain.
No insurance entity should have the right to interfere in my healthcare providers prescribing, be it opioid pain medications, diabetes or heart medications. My medical care should be left to my doctors, who understand my complicated and complex case. No one at CMS/Medicare/Medicaid or any pharmacist knows my complex health issues and there is not a ""one size fits all"" treatment.  
While seeking an exemption to the90MME and the 7-day supply limit it will in fact cause extreme stress for the patients, a huge paperwork burden for doctors and staff, a financial burden to the patient due to additional copays at the pharmacy and doctor offices, not to mention that fact that people who are in pain will have to make multiple trips to their doctors and pharmacies, while dealing with pain. Many of the people living with pain are on strict and limited budgets and having to pay out additional and unneeded copays can make the difference in someone buying the needed medications or buying groceries.
CMS and CDC must see that making all these new regulations and polices like a 7-day limit is not and will not stop overdose's because those who are overdosing are using illicit heroin and illicit fentanyl that is coming in from other countries. If the CDC, CMS, FDA and DEA want to stop overdoses in the United States then put more resources to stopping the dangerous illicit drugs from coming into the country. 
It is already known and documented that the prescribing of legitimate FDA approved pain medications has been going down for over 5 years, mostly due to CDC regulations and guidelines that have spooked doctors from prescribing the opioid mediations out of fear and yet the overdoses from illicit drugs are continuing to climb.
Stop punishing legitimate people in pain for what is an illicit drug problem.

If the 7-day supply limit is imposed on long term pain patients who are stable on FDA approved legitimate pain medications the policies will in fact cause:
 more doctors to shy away from treating pain          
 it will force more people with pain to apply for disability, who right now are able to continue to work because the opioid medications are easing the pain enough to allow them to continue to work.
 Emergency rooms will be over-burdened with patients who are no longer able to handle the severe pain and see no way of getting help except the ER and if refused pain relief at the ER, it will increase the rate of suicides among people living with pain.

I tried Chiropractors, massage therapy, it exacerbated my pain.

Loosing access to them would be no way to spend my remaining years. Opioids allow me to live and care for myself personally. I still have some difficulties but they allow me to live. I have been on them 20 years and they allowed me to work 10 more years than I would have been able to otherwise. Medical issues are due to accident and necessitate their use. 
Please allow me to live what years I have left with some dignity and with what quality of life I can. Taking patients off of pain medicines that are stable on them makes no sense. I do not understand what purpose this would serve other than to save money. Taking away proper dosing to stable patients would be inhumane and is my belief it would be contrary to our Constitutions intent. Every patient is an individual and has individual needs and rights.

"650","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am against these policy changes. These changes are dangerously harmful to chronic pain patients and all patients. They are not based on any accurate data regarding evidenced based treatment for patients in pain or the opiate epidemic. Patients using medications perscribed for them are NOT the cause of the opiate epidemic. Illegal fentanyl and heroin are. Perscription opiates alone are only responsible for 2300 opiate deaths. 14000 deaths are the result of opiates AND other medications. Thus no single medication can be held accountable. The other opiate deaths are the result of illegal opiates. These numbers are based on recorded Cause of Death; however standards for cause of death are not standardized snd thus should not be used for policy decisions. Perscription medications do not lead to addiction as shown by the recent NIH study. 

Medical doctors should be in charge of patient treatment, NOT insurance policy makers. Doctors amd patients are not the cause of the opiate epidemic. Opiate perscriprions have been declining since 2011 and are at an all time low. Yet opiate overdoses climb, due to illegal fentanyl and heroin. There are over 108 million patients in chronic pain amd 2.5 million addicts. Patients in pain deserve treatment that relieves their pain. These patients have tries other medications or treatments which do not work. A comprehensive study by AHQR shows that alernative treatments have little efficacy. Many studies as well as the long time success of patients using opiates safely demonstrates their efficacy and necessity. Forcing patients off of these neccessary medications will result in more patients on disability, more patients committing suicide. The number of pain related suicides due to denial of neccessary medications has already risen from the CDC guidelines.

Forcing patients to follow some arbitrary 7 day schedule is unrealistic and inappropriately burdensome. This would cause additional financial costs for doctor visits (to patients and Medicare) as well as increased costs at the pharmacy (for patients and medicare). The additional barriers violate the Americans with Disabilities provisions. Patients in chronic pain have disabilities and should not be barred or face additional barriers to appropriate treatment. There is no evidence that these measures will improve patient safety anf ample evidence of imcreased health issues and suicide from untreated pain. Thus there is no validity for these measures only obvious harrassment of a group of over 108 million individuals with disabilities.

In addition to chronic pain, patients in acute pain would also be similarly harmed by 7 day perscriptions. Besides additional costs, patients may not be physically able to travel to appointments post procedures. This could lead to longer hospiatal stays, increased injuries from trying to travel too soon, longer recovery times, more time off work or on short term disability. 

In summary, there is no evidence that these messures will affect the opiate epidemic or patient safety. There is ample evidence that they will harm patients, increase pain related suicide, increase patient and insurance costs, prove an inappropriate barrier to individuals with disabilities, and violate the rights of individuals numbering over 108million. All of these facts are in addition to the ethics of compassionate and evidenced based treatment and the World Health Federations assertion that appropriate treatment for pain in a human right. Please recognize the lack of evidence for these changes, as well as the huge costs- financially and in human lives.

That's because while there is a physical component to addiction, the social and mental aspects are far more important. To reduce addiction, we need to ensure that we are building strong communities, ensuring everyone has their basic needs for food, shelter, etc. met, and ensure that all people are treated with dignity. 

Cutting off the medications that help so many people avoid suffering, work or take care of others even with chronic conditions, and die with some measure of dignity does nothing to stop addiction. It simply hurts and kills people. 

I urge you to remove your recommendation for 7-day hard limits, as well as your restriction for 90MME. These are not based in science. We do know, however, they will hurt people if they are enacted.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0012","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-05T00:00:00-05:00","Anonymous-MA"

"669","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a practicing Hospice and Palliative Care Physician.  I am the medical director of a large hospice in Chicago.

While Hospice Medications don't come from Part D:  The hospice system is designed around attending physicians providing adequate dosages of pain and other symptom management medications.   I can tell you that they barely achieve this adequate dosing because of fear and current CII medication requirements.  Adding additional fear of dosage maximums or other paperwork around a particular dose will HURT patients who are in Hospice and Palliative care.

Patients with multiple co-morbidities who are not terminally ill by hospice requirements (or those in the Medicare Choice Model - [Part D prescriptions needed]) and seeking palliative and comfort care will be hurt by any maximum prescribed dosage, even if it is just a warning or additional piece of paper.  Any access or restrictive regulation will create suffering in this population.  It already exists due to current state CII requirements.

Patients with metastatic cancer, chemotherapy induced neuropathy, or other other breathing symptoms before hospice have a large opioid need and will be hurt by any regulation.  We already see them being admitted to hospice in pain crisis.

While the intent is to reduce use of inappropriate opioid use including 7 day supplies for acute pain, etc, the most risky and vulnerable populations will be affected as a clear anticipated consequence.

Lastly, the burden of diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuropathy and chemotherapy induced neuropathy is significant and the off-label use of gabapentin and pregabalin is necessary for these patients. There are several good quality studies showing usefullness despite the companies not going for additional approval.  Now that the main drug is generic, this will not happen.   I have seen them work significantly and reduce the need for opioid medication by more than half, reducing risks and providing relief.  Do not regulate these drugs.

I am a patient advocate and work with chronic pain patients and those who suffer with addiction. 
I feel the opiate limits purposed will make it difficult to treat patients effectively by their providers. There are so many variables between, illness, injures, recovery, chronic vs acute pain and the way some people metabolize opiates. Pain patients need there medications and very little diversion is happening from them as a group at this time. Doctors need to be able to treat each person as a individual according to their needs without a restraint that isn't flexible for each patients individual needs. I understand limits, guidelines and caution with Opiates medications. Caution is also needed so we don't go so far to the left that patients in neeed of Opiate medications are under treated causing unnecessary suffering and additional stress on the patient and further impacting the family unit. When chronic pain is under treated that also drives addiction with the extra life stresses and negative impact on the family. The hardship for the elderly, acute, post op recovery or chronic pain patient to go to the pharmacy every 7 days hinders their treatment and recovery by adding additional stress and often causing painflares that can take a day or so to recover from. planning, assistance needed and a day or so to recover after the trip is something to consider. 
When it comes Gabapentin it is over prescribed for low to no evidence reasons. Working with patients who abuse and divert substances. Gabapentin is highly abused at this time and underestimated with a lack of any substantial evidence on its use for pain outside of painful diabetic neuropathy. Even then it not FDA approved and off-label because it's only 38% effective for that indication Cochrane review. It's being abused in high dosages but also low dosages individually. The low dosages are preferred because of its reverse bio availability and short half life. They use tricks to hack the low dosages. The evidence based article on the topic are underestimating it abuse potential and the reality. Part of the problem is it wasn't being tracked and monitored for any evidence to be available to use. Just because there was no evidence doesn't mean it's not being diverted. 
Gabapentin ""as prescribed"" and not abused can cause Dependence and withdrawals for some. Typically it's when Polypharmacy with an opiate or a Benzodiazepines that acute Gabapentin withdrawals can happen. It's also happening by patient accounts with long time high dosage Users. I have personally witnessed acute Gabapentin withdrawals and it mimic acute Benzodiazepines withdrawals in intensity and duration. These patients are to often left unsupported by their medical providers who are not understanding that some people can be titrated off how is normally done. The other end of the spectrum is acute Gabapentin withdrawals that should be treated as Dependence and a actual withdrawal syndrome. The same can be said for Lyrica. both Gabapentin and Lyrica are pushing illicit opiate overdoses by approx 50% when abused together. Gabapentin is over prescribed and has no controls. I don't think a Federal Scheduled V is to much to ask to help track, monitor and get more scientific evidence on what Gabapentin is doing on the diversion side of things and to monitor those co-prescribed for safety. Many think Gabapentin is the next addiction crisis in the making and already getting a good foothold under the radar. Schedule V doesn't limit the reasons it's prescribed, it doesn't impact patient care. Schedule V simply tracks and monitors as a safely valve for those co-prescribed and take their medications as directed it also aids It diversion alerts and stats and can help reduce diversion with limits on early refills monthly.

"674","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic severe/intractable pain patient of 23 years. Disabled, after terrible spinal injuries after a serious automobile accident, due to no fault of my own. I suffer from neck, head, chest, and back pain. Degenerative disc disease in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, with many disc herniations, bulging, bone spurs, spinal stenosis, spondylosis, degenerative joint disease, and a twisted spine. A failed cervical fusion/laminectomy neck surgery which left me with even more severe pain and dysfunction. I also suffer from chronic myofascial pain, fibromyalgia, costochondritis, autoimmune disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, occipital neuralgia, radiculopathy, and anemia. My severe/intractable pain was under-treated for 12 years. After trying everything possible. All physical therapies, injections, chiropractor, and a host of pharmacueticals. The only thing that I found to help relieve some of my severe pain, were pain medications. Specifically, opiates/opioids. After many years of my pain being slightly helped by lower dose opioids, I was finally helped after 13 years, with a higher dose of a particular opioid. And after being in and out of the hospital for severe pain, and a neck surgery that failed to relieve my unbearable pain. I am thankful for this medication. Though disabled for 23 years, this medication helps to relieve my pain enough to where I no longer wish to die. Years of being bedridden, and writhing in pain from under-treatment, left me begging god to just take me. No human can sustain such levels of unbearable and torturous pain. The unbearable pain felt like torture. No one with such high levels of pain should ever have to suffer to that extent, when there are medications that help to relieve their pain. Many people with severe injuries, diseases, and conditions, need higher doses of pain medication to reach and help to control at least some of their pain. I am now being under-treated, because my dose was lowered by 25% 2 years ago, when a previous doctor decided not to treat pain patients anymore. Because of the pressure the dea and state were putting on her, as she treated her patients with opiates/opioids for their severe pain. The government should not interfere between the doctor and patient relationship. My doctor knows me best after 13 years of treating my injuries and diseases. Putting limits on the amount and dosage of pain medication a patient can receive, will hurt myself, and tens of millions of pain patients with legitimate diseases and conditions, that would otherwise be helped by them. There are already tight drug monitoring systems and urine testing in place to safeguard against abuse and diversion. I take my medication as directed. I need it to help control my pain, so I at least don't wish to die, from unrelieved severe pain. Anymore tighter limitations or restrictions, will only hurt legitimate patients who need these medications to help ease high levels of pain and better function. This proposal would be hurting the wrong people. The cause of this so called crisis is from illegal/illicit non prescription street drugs. Fentanyl from China and Mexico, mixed into illegal street drugs such as heroin, cocaine, meth, fentanyl, and illegal counterfeit pills, by pill machines. Made by drug dealers on the streets, such as counterfeit vicodin, percocet, zanax, etc. By recreational drug users who buy, make, and sell these on the streets. Legitimate pain patients with severe diseases, injuries, and conditions, are not to blame. I feel we have become collateral damage in this so called crisis. You're targeting the wrong people, while the bad guys are still on the streets doing harm. Legitmate pain patients will continue to be hurt, and suffer, while the recreational drug users on the streets will continue to get there illegal/drugs, wreeking havac, and causing harm from illegal/illicit fentanyl. I don't want to suffer from under-treated severe/intractable pain. And don't want to go back to feeling as if I want to die, while writhing in pain, from even more under-treatment of my pain. This would also allow insurance companies to victimize patients, by refusing to pay for much needed medications. if they are further restricted in any way. Allow experienced doctors to do their jobs in treating their patients in the best way they know how. There are so many variables when it comes to treating each patient. We are all unique. We have different levels of injuries, diseases, illnesses, and conditions. Many of us have multiple injuries/diseases on top of the other, and are complex. There is no one size fits all, across the board approach to treating patients. We are all so different, with a different set of circumstances. Go after the bad guys and allow the professional doctors to treat their patients, with their best interests in mind. All this will do is hurt legitimate patients even further, by choosing not to treat their severe painful diseases at all.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0554","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Marilyn Anonymous-MI"

"679","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm writing to urge that you please don't let the government set standard opioid dose limits for individual patients, which will happen if CMS adopts policies based on the scientifically flawed CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines.

I inherited a permanently painful and disabling connective tissue disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and have been taking high doses of opioids for over 20 years. I was able to maintain employment for 10 of those years before the pain became too great.

Countless other treatments, therapies, and medications, were ineffective or far too expensive. For me and many others, only opioids provide effective pain relief. 

Enforcing arbitrary opioid dose limits is cruel and unusual punishment for pain patients.

Thanks to opioids I'm still functional enough to write you this letter, even though it took me a couple of days to organize and complete. 

Below are 5 reasons not to stipulate arbitrary (not backed by research) dose limits for individuals.

1 ** Opioid dose restrictions unfairly discriminate against people with permanent pain.

The ""standard"" maximum dosage of 90MME is far less than what's currently used by patients who have been taking prescribed opioids for decades and have developed high tolerances. 

This dose limit unfairly targets patients (like me) who have painful diseases, genetic flaws, or have been in terrible accidents, 

Worst of all, this will effectively condemn veterans who were gravely wounded and have permanent injuries to a lifetime of pain. How can we force them to suffer like this?

2 ** The CDC Guideline on which the restrictions are based has many flaws and inconsistencies and was only intended to guide, not dictate specific doses.

It was created by a group of addiction specialists, and pain management needs were not considered.

The evidence used for the guideline was cherry-picked in an unusual pattern which excluded evidence in favor of opioids for pain relief.

It is biased, based on admittedly manipulated data, and overlooks essential facts about opioid prescribing.

3 ** Standard medication dosages imposed by the government are inappropriate for medical practice. 

People have different genetic profiles that cause them to metabolize opioids differently, so doses can vary by a factor of 10.

The CDC Guidelines were never intended to set specific dosage limits, yet they are being used to legislate absolute rules for what should be individualized medical decisions.

Our government claims to be committed to ""Individualized Medicine"" with the Precision Medicine Initiative. We know that the most effective treatments must be tailored to the genetics of each individual.

4 ** The frightening ""opioid overdose crisis"" numbers are created by adding together very different drugs, users, and motivations.

There is little overlap between legitimate prescriptions used for pain relief and illegal heroin and street drugs used for recreation. The conflated data confuses the motives of people in pain with those looking for a recreational high or staving off withdrawal.

Limits intended for one problematic population (recreational users) will strongly impact a different and innocent population (patients with permanent pain).

5 ** The ""crisis"" is one of addiction - not any particular drug - and is more related to psychological, social, and economic factors than prescriptions.

Most of the overdoses come from street drugs mixed with fentanyl illicitly imported from China or lethal combinations of different drugs.

As opioid medications become scarce, recreational users simply switch to street opioids like heroin. But pain patients cannot switch because they need legal, measured, and quality assured medication.

** Results so far: prescriptions way down, overdoses way up

The latest CDC data show that prescriptions have been declining since 2010 and street opioids, often laced with illicit fentanyl, are driving the growing numbers of overdose deaths. 

It becomes increasingly clear that prescription restrictions do not reduce deaths because overdoses aren't from the same ""opioids"".

Please don't deprive me and so many other citizens of pain relief based on some generic dosage for the mythical ""average"" American.

Would strongly suggest that these proposed limitations are in violation of ADA and CRA.
Likewise drawing a distinction between pain associated with cancer deserves some preferential treatment than pain associated with any other physical disorder once again suggests a violation of the protected class under the ADA and CRA for those diagnosed with ICP.
Placing daily MME limits without regards to the pt's CYP-450 opiate metabolism is further discrimination for a subset of the protected class.
There is no known clinical trials that these conversion tables have degree of certainty making a conversion from one opiate to another.
Here are warning/advisories from one such set of conversion tables: http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.cgi

* Published equianalgesic ratios are considered crude estimates at best and therefore it is imperative that careful consideration is given to individualizing the dose of the selected opioid. Dosage titration of the new opioid should be completed slowly and with frequent monitoring.

*Factors that must be addressed during the conversion process include: Age of the patient or presence of coexisting conditions. Use additional caution with elderly patients (65 years and older), and in patients with liver, renal, or pulmonary disease.

* Conversion ratios in many equianalgesic dosing tables do not apply to repeated doses of opioids.

* The amount of residual drug in the patient's system must be accounted for. Example: fentanyl will continue to be released from the skin 12 to 36 hours after removal of the patch. Residual effects from discontinued long-acting formulations should also be assessed before converting a patient to a new opioid.

* The use of high but ineffective doses of a previous opioid may result in overestimation of the converted opioid.

* Ideally, methadone conversions (especially patients who were previously receiving high doses of an opioid) should only be attempted in cooperation with a pain specialist or a specialist in palliative medicine.

* Meperidine should be used for acute dosing only and not used for chronic pain management (meperidine has a short half-life and a toxic metabolite: normeperidine). Its use should also be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency, CHF, hepatic insufficiency, and the elderly because of the potential for toxicity due to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine. Seizures, confusion, tremors, or mood alterations may be seen. In patients with normal renal function, total daily doses should not exceed 600mg/24hrs.

The practice of medicine is part art ... part science and all therapy is based on a individual's response to a particular therapy and to try and establish ""cook book therapies"" deviates from and violates accepted standard of care and best practice.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0721","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Steve Ariens-IN"

It appears ""Depression"" is different than ""Major Depression"" and is counted differently and therefore the former isn't considered for payment? The statistics are mind blowing. I have noticed most people in chronic pain are speaking about that in particular. I, too, have several chronic conditions which are not discussed and yet it has caused disability and an incredible amount of pain. I take opioid medication and without it, I would have little quality of life. I have anxiety and insomnia and so am given a benzodiazepine as well.

My son has chronic migraines and must take over 90 MMEs per day when he has a migraine along with a benzodiazepine for anxiety and sleep. He is disabled and seldom leaves his home.

I rely on opioid medications to be able to get out of bed, go to the grocery store, cook for myself, bathe and dress myself, go to doctor appointments and various therapies. Extended release opioids are beneficial to me because they allow me to go much longer between doses, as the immediate release medications only last a couple hours for me and I find myself suffering at least one or two hours before the next dose can be taken. That might not seem like long, but when you're in terrible pain, every minute feels like an hour. I was on a therapeutic level of medication for seven years where I was able to function at a level where I was hoping to return to the workforce soon. After the CDC released its new guidelines for prescribing pain medications, the clinic I was going to changed their prescribing practices and I was cut off cold turkey. I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a doctor to take over my care but everyone had adopted the same policies. I spent eight months in excruciating pain, wishing I would just fall asleep and never wake up. I have pain that is never going to go away and after years of trying alternative treatments, accepted opioids were the only thing that allowed me to have some quality of life. While I was completely off opioids, my blood pressure that was always normal before was now registering extremely high every time I went to the doctor. It cost my insurance so much more money as I was forced to go to the ER whenever the pain got unbearable, which was often. I finally found a doctor who looked at all of my medical records and understands why I'm in so much pain and have been placed back on a pain management program. I have not had to visit the ER since. 
I keep my medication in a locked vault and it is never accessible to anyone other than me. 
I wish doctors understood that opioids do not make chronic pain patients high or euphoric. The effect that people who use these medications recreationally get does not happen when you have chronic pain. The pain eats up that effect and we simply feel less pain. If I seem happier after my pain medicine kicks in, it's because I have less pain and I can focus on something other than the pain and feel almost like I did before I started having health problems. Opioids do not make me feel tired or groggy. They ease the pain enough that you can function, but it never takes all of the pain away. It's pain management, not pain cure. 
If enacted, these policies stand to hurt way more people than they'd help. No two people have the same pain. How can someone else possibly know the maximum dose it's going to take to give me moderate pain relief? People metabolize these medications differently. Having a one size fits all for opioid use will be detrimental to many patients.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0652","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Anonymous-MN"

I am a chronic pain/ intractable pain patient, and have been for 13 years now. At the age of twentyfour I was hit by a drunk driver in 2005 which caused my car to roll a minimum of eight times. I was hospitalized for nine months, four of which were learning to walk again. Since that day I have lived every second in pain. The first three years after the accident were horrible and left me in excruciating pain. I went to physical therapy, water therapy,acupuncture,biofeedback etc appointments weekly for years. I was put on non-opioid medication after medication for years. I was bed ridden and could not function enough to even bathe myself. I had to have everything from bathing to changing my clothes to feeding myself done for me. It was a horrible existence which at times I felt I didn't want to deal with anymore. In 2008 I finally found a good pain managment doctor whom after reading through my chart and seeing everything I had tried prior, decided to place me on a prescription of opioids. At first ot was difficult as they made me sick. I didn't like the feeling they gave me. After a few weeks and with the help of nausea medication I felt that this medication was a god send to me. I was still in pain but instead of it being all consuming, I was able to put it at the back of my thoughts enough that I could cope again. Opioids literally gave me my life back. Everything I was unable to do prior I could now do again. I was able to go back to work and live the life I should have been living to begin with. I was no longer an invalid. Starting in 2009 through 2016 I was on what some would call a high dose but that dose was the same for seven years and stayed that way. That was the dose that helped me to be a functioning member of society. I was able to marry and have a child and take care of that child when it was found she has autism. In March of 2016 my to me withthe cdc's opioid prescribing guidelines and old me my medications had to be lowered. Once again I was suffering and found I could no longer care for myself,  my child.  Without the dose of medications that work well for me I am now on SSI. I can't do the things that I need to do . I especially can't do the th8ngs I once loved to do. Wether it be gardening or sewing or playing with my animals. This has also taken a toll on my eleven year old autistic daughter. I understand the need for rules and regulations to be put in place so that people aren't taking these medications for months when it should only have been a couple days. I see the need for life saving medications and help for addicts. Though so far people like me are caught in the crossfire and are suffering. I understand that you think these rules and regulations will help but an addict will always find a way to get what they want. While law abiding citizens like myself will suffer and loose an semblance of living we once had. You may think I am over exaggerating, but I promise you I am not. Since 2008 I have been a Part of several pain groups online as well in person. I have in the past been a part of advocacy groups with people suffering like myself. Since the cdc guidelines were implemented thousands of people like myself are suffering. I see it all the time of social media.Twitter, Facebook, Instagram..everywhere. Every place, every group that are putting these rules into place are forcing people like myself into torture they can't escape from. I have yet to meet someone who wanted to be on opioids. I have yet to meet someone like myself that didn't wish they could be normal and didn't have to try and cope with unrelenting pain. If given the choice every last one of us would choose to be normal. We don't have that option! The only option most of us do have are opioid medications, and many at higher doses.

"695","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"People using pain medication in order to have a quality of life worth living should not be punished.
In 1989, I underwent my first surgery to remove Salivary Gland Tumors.  They were benign. I suffered minimal permanent damage to my face, neck, & jaw. However, they returned.  In 2002, I had two different doctors remove a total of 13 tumors from my neck & face.  In 2001, I had two different surgeons remove a lump in my breast.  
I have had chronic jaw / face pain since 2002; over 15 years.  I have been prescribed everything from anticonvulsants to anti-inflammatory (steroid & nonsteroid) to various strengths of opioids.  
I work full-time and my job requires focus and accuracy. I do not have the luxury to overmedicate and hang out in bed all day; nor do I have room in my life for brain fog and lethargy caused by many medications.  
For over 10 years now, I have been able to manage my pain with opioid medication. The medication does not remove the pain, but allows pain to be reduced to a level so that I can work and have an active quality of life. 
For the past decade, I have watched my doctor become increasingly tied down with regulations that have increased my financial obligation. I use to go to the doctor a couple times a year and the pharmacy could call in my refill. The ACA caused my deductible to increase AND I must now go to see the doctor every three months ($145.00). In addition to the cost of seeing the doctor every three months, I need to take time off work to go see the doctor (4x per year), this doesn't leave me much time to take off for dental, mammogram, or just calling off work sick (thankfully, I don't get sick but every 4 or 5 years.)  I don't see how I would be able to continue to work full-time if I was required to take off work every week to see my doctor to get the medication I need to manage my pain so that I could work.  I also don't see how this would stop people from abusing medication. I should think that those abusing would be able to find time to go to the doctors as often as needed. 
In the past year, I have had 4 pharmacies turn my prescriptions away. One even told me that I needed to bring in other medications (cholesterol, asthma, diabetes...), and then they would be able to fill my prescription for pain medication.  But, alas, I am a healthy person living with chronic pain so I am out of luck.  
I was admitted into the hospital a couple years back because of chest pain (I also have mitral valve prolapse) and I kept telling them NOT to give me pain medication because the look in their eyes when I mention pain - it is like they were scanning me as if I was a drug criminal. In order for them to consider an actual problem, I had to reassure them I was not there for pain medication.  
Currently, my tumors are back. The doctor wants to biopsy.  1- I don't want to take time off work to do that. 2- The MRI was $500 and the doctor visit to read the MRI was another $200. I don't think I could afford the biopsy. 3- The pain is getting worse. I am tired of feeling the need to tell the kid behind the RX counter that I have tumors in my head and that is why I need the pain medication.  4- Will my employer of 5 years continue to give me time off work? As I said before, I am seldom sick. It is hard to tell them I need all of this time off to go to doctors without telling them my medical history, which is none of their business.  5- I am terrified of the day my doctor retires. New doctors don't take the time to read the file and understand the situation. I know because my doctor switched medical groups. I had three or four new doctors with my old group. Each one would hear my jaw pain story and start back on step #1.  I had to change medical insurance (paying much more money) to switch medical groups to go back to my doctor. He runs extra blood work to be sure my vitamins/ minerals are good, while checking my liver, sugar, and other vitals.  He is a rare find and I watch as his hands, to practice medicine and treat me, get tied behind his back.

Our group is comprised of severe intractable pain patients and their family members.  FIPR's goals are:

(2)	To advocate for access to standard and non-standard pain therapies to treat severe intractable pain, including opioids and non-opioid pain medications, hormones, anti-inflammatory agents, and adjuvant treatments as appropriate.

FIPR strongly opposes the proposed policies that will implement hard edits on opioid prescriptions at or above 90 mg MED that can only be overridden by insurance companies.  This proposal will, if implemented, deny effective analgesia to millions of seniors, and poor and disabled citizens.  These changes will, without doubt, damage and deny care to large numbers of the 1.6 million patients presently estimated by CMS to receive daily opioid pain treatment above 90 mg MED.

Unless you live with moderate to severe chronic pain or are a caretaker you have little to no understainding on the effects of severe debilitating pain. 90mg MME does not take in to consideration opiate tolerance as many patients have lived with chronic severe pain daily for years and even decaids, leading to a necessary increase in dosage to achieve the same desired effect. You are taking away what makes living tolerable, the ability to perform even simple daily functions, the ability to sleep and without sleep a body can not heal yet will continue to break down even further. The #s put out by the C.D.C. for overdoses are very misleading. It appears as if these overdoses occur in legitimate chronic pain patients with prescriptions, yet it includes overdoses caused by illegal drug use, combinations of prescription drugs acquired illegally and illegally mixed with alcohol or street drugs; the true # of over dose deaths by ligitement chronic pain patients are not used, which are minimal in contributing to overdoses deaths when taken as prescribed. Actually greater than 200mg MME, the highest dosage considered by the CDC, has the least amount of overdoses in the catagorized dosages amount. Many factors influence this, these patients have normally been chronically ill for quite some time with a slow triatation upwards in dosage, and patients at this level most I believe would never sell their drugs or share them as they depend on them to do simple daily activities such as walk, bath, & other simple activities many take for granted, and for fear of living with any more pain than they already do even with medication therapy. You never hear how many patients die from untreated and undertreated chronic pain from heart disease as their blood pressure risies immensily due to the pain and they experience tachycardia. One of the most dangerous drugs prescribed causing overdoses is Morphine yet funding is increased for this addiction treatment, when safer non-opoid alternatives are available. This bill will also turn many legitimate chronic pain patients to seek drugs from the street, desperate to alleviate their pain, causing even more heroin overdose deaths! This ideology is shear madness on to many levels to even mention! Not to mention how unethical and inhumane it is to allow human beings to suffer unnecessarily! It is time for the government to stop interfering with the doctor patient relationships and to not demand how a medical professional who is knowledgeable of the individuals health decides to treat their patient! So many patients our already being left with no where to turn for treatment or receive inadequate treatment for their pain, as doctors choose to toss aside their oath to do no harm in fear of lossing their medical license. Pennsylvania just enforced this for Medicaid patients only, discriminatory to say the least, patients are being turned away, denied treatment, can not get their medications covered as Medicaid is no longer using independent insurance companies but Manage Care Organizations, code for government influenced organizations, limiting and abruptly stopping patients access to their quality of life sustaining medications! They say the are following the CDC's guidelines, not so, these were meant to be a guideline not mandatory practice. Next the CDC states these recommendations should not apply to patients with cancer, pallitive care patients, or hospice patients. Medicaid does not cover pallitive care, they provide a equivelant called managed long-term care, its their wording choice for patients who by the state of Pennsylvania have been deemed equal to nursing home level of care & to cut back on medical cost they remain in home instead of a group nursing home while receiving services similiar to those they would receive in a nursing home and pallitive care setting, yet they are not exempting these patients from the 90 mg MME, which according to the CDC these guidelines should NOT apply to patients in this advanced of a condition. Now if thats not ludicrous and inhumane I do not know what is! Many of these patients who should be living as humanly as possible are now flooding the internet with thoughts of being forced to take their own lives! STOP THE MADNESS!! Then the figures stating Medicaid and Medicare patients exceed the national average for opiate use, well common sense would say the chronically ill would need more access to pain control than the healthy population. This is discriminatory at the very least. Addiction is a problem in this country that needs addressed but not at the expense of the chronically ill being left to suffer due to actions of street addicts!

Minnesota Department of Human Services Comments 
March 5, 2018

The Minnesota Department of Human Services (MN DHS) is the State Medicaid Agency for the State of Minnesota. We thank CMS for the opportunity to comment on the provisions of the 2018 Advance Payment Notice and Draft Call Letter.  

As the sponsor of the first integrated state Medicare Medicaid demonstration approved by CMS in 1995, MN DHS has over 20 years of history and experience in managing integrated Medicare-Medicaid programs through combined Medicaid and Medicare managed care platforms including Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs).  The Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO) program began in 1995 and serves over 38,000 dually eligible seniors enrolled in seven FIDE SNPs that provide the full range of Medicaid managed long term services and supports (MLTSS) benefits.  While enrollment in MSHO remains voluntary, most Medicaid seniors have chosen MSHO. DHS also manages a companion mandatory Medicaid MLTSS program called Minnesota Senior Care Plus (MSC+) for Medicaid seniors serving about 16,000 enrollees.  MSC+ is offered by the same MSHO plan sponsors.  
 
Minnesota and all MSHO plans are participating in CMS' alternative D-SNP demonstration, the Federal-State Partnership to Align Administrative Functions for Improvements in Medicare-Medicaid Beneficiary Experience, under a Memorandum of Understanding with CMS through the MMCO.   

As a state that has made long term investments in utilizing D-SNPs as a platform for integration of Medicare and Medicaid, DHS shares an interest with CMS in assuring that Medicare Advantage policies, including those for payment, quality measures, member materials, and models of care are appropriate and fair for combined D-SNP/Medicaid plans. We are pleased to submit the following comments which we hope will be helpful to CMS. 


2018 ADVANCE PAYMENT NOTICE COMMENTS

1.	Special Needs Plan (SNP) - Specific Networks Research and Development - page 185

Last year, CMS announced its intent to move forward on developing SNP-specific network adequacy evaluations.   This year CMS is indicating in the CY 2019 call letter that the existing process now accounts for the unique health care needs and delivery pattern for SNPs.   This is contrary to the experience in Minnesota where for the past three years, under Minnesota's alignment demonstration, Minnesota health plans have tested a process of meeting network adequacy standards based on the actual dual eligible population rather than the entire Medicare eligible population.   Because of the rural nature of state, practice patterns and geography, it was not uncommon for a D-SNP seeking to offer a statewide product to have complete 350 exception templates.    During our demonstration, this same health plan only had to submit 3-4 exception templates to serve a statewide D-SNP population.   We also worked with CMS on creating an exception template that more accurately reflects to exception being requested and the reason for the exemption.

In addition, the demonstration allowed for the involvement of the State in the review process of the exceptions our health plans submitted.  We were able to assist CMS in determining needed updates to their database of providers and understanding the effect of geography.  We also assisted in updating the exception templates used by the health plans.  We encourage CMS to continue work on network adequacy processes for D-SNPs and explore implementing some of the processes that Minnesota has tested and found administratively useful.

2.	Improving Beneficiary Communications and Reducing Burden for Integrated D-SNPs  page 187

In the Draft Call Letter, CMS highlights specific opportunities for states to attain better administrative alignment in their integrated D-SNP/Medicaid managed long-term services and supports (MLTSS) programs.  Minnesota applauds the CMS efforts to support administrative alignment for Medicare-Medicaid programs, including:
	Improved communication and information sharing between the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and states for D-SNP oversight purposes;
	Creation of integrated model materials such as Summary of Benefits documents, Annual Notice of Change and Evidence of Coverage documents, Provider and Pharmacy Directories, and integrated drug formularies;
	Use of integrated processes for D-SNP non-renewal (e.g., state-specific non-renewal notices that include related Medicaid information); and
	Development of integrated Models of Care that incorporate information about states' MLTSS programs into D-SNPs' Models of Care.

Association (NADSA) we commend CMS for its proposal to expand the scope of the primarily health related supplemental

adult day services meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance
to include ADS in plan offerings.

The primary purpose of adult day services is to reduce avoidable and emergency healthcare utilization by providing 
person-centered, comprehensive maintenance and skilled services up to seven days per week, 12 hours per day, in a 
supervised, congregated setting. Adult day services generally fall into two models, social adult day care (SADC) and adult day 
health care (ADHC). SADC services include supervision, socialization, healthy and nutritious meals, therapeutic activities and 
some or total assistance with personal care. ADHC models further provide skilled nursing, medication management, personal 
care, and therapeutic activities. Some centers also provide restorative and maintenance physical, occupational, and speech 
therapies, psychological and dietary counseling services. Most centers provide transportation, social work and care 
management services to ameliorate functional and psychological impact of injuries or chronic health conditions. These 
services are generally provided at a per-diem rate, which is much lower, and has more benefit, than providing individual 
services in the home. Simply being in the center provides a safe, supervised and socially stimulating environment which 
reduces chronic isolation often experienced by older adults and supports the overall physical, cognitive and mental health 
of the beneficiary.

Across the nation, ADS beneficiaries have experienced reductions of avoidable hospitalizations and delayed nursing home 
placement. A study by the New York State Department of Health credited the continuous health monitoring and health 
education provided in medical model adult day programs with the findings that 70% of participants with multiple chronic

Instead of allocating resources to go after drug dealers, the government will make individuals on disability suffer needlessly. I find it very difficult to believe what has happened to this country. Individual freedoms are being taken away. 
Does the government want individuals to suffer in pain? Is that the goal. Medications affect each individual differently. While on person may be able to have their pain controlled on 60 MME morphine equivalent, another person may need 120 MME or higher to have their pain controlled due to genetic differences. Why is it that an individual can go to a liquor store everyday and buy a bottle of vodkaor bourbon and drink every night till they pass ou and repeat this everyday, but an individual can not obtain the necessary pain medication to alleviate their chronic pain. Individuals who have never been in chronic pain have no clue what life in pain is like. I would bet the people who are making these rules would not last three days.

Pain management is a basic human right, according to the World Health Organization. What kind of country do we live in when this right is blatantly ignored and the health of many placed in jeopardy? These measures violate my civil rights. When has it ever been acceptable for an insurance company to treat patients, to make medical decisions for them? I've never heard of this. I thought it was illegal. I don't see the Government placing dose restrictions on insulin or blood pressure medication. There's no difference here. Pain medication is as much a vital part of my treatment as insulin is to a diabetic. I am disabled due to an intractable pain condition called, Adhesive Arachnoiditis. It's a progressive inflammatory disease of the nerves of the spinal cord. My spinal cord is tethered, due to this condition. It causes severe, intractable pain 24/7 and causes many other limitations, including neurogenic bladder, chronic daily headaches and frequent migraines, to name only a few. These measures are a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. I am disabled. There's no guarantee that my doctor will agree to pursue the pre-authorization process. He may feel that this would bring too much attention upon him from the DEA and fear losing his license and livelihood. He may see this as cost prohibitive and decide to not exceed the Morphine 90mg mme for any of his patients, regardless of their need or whether the patient will be adversely impacted, including death due to complications from under treated pain, death and potentially suicide. He may see this as Government overreach and decide it's no longer safe to prescribe pain medication at all. The Government should stay out of my doctor's office and stop violating the doctor patient relationship. All these decisions about my care will be made about me, WITHOUT me. I will have no say in the decision process. If my doctor chooses to lower my dose or stop prescribing opioids at all, I will have no say. There's no appeal process for a physician's decision. And it's very difficult now to find a doctor to treat pain. Even pain management doctors have stopped prescribing opioids due to fear of the DEA. I'm not a candidate for spinal procedures, like injections, as they are contraindicated for Arachnoiditis. They can cause progression of the disease, including paralysis. I have tried everything else. Physical therapy makes my pain and mobility worse. I've tried every vitamin and supplement imaginable. They are expensive and of little help with my severe pain. Insurance doesn't cover alternative therapies, like acupuncture or massage therapy. Medical marijuana is not available here and I don't know if it would help me anyway. I do know that opioids help me function. They allow me to get out of bed each day and function on a limited basis. On a good day I take a short walk or go out to dinner. I've been on a stable dose for 3 years. I've reduced the dose twice, by choice. There's no medical reason to reduce my dose now. I have no history of drug abuse or addiction. I get no euphoria or high from them. I have zero cravings for them. I feel and function perfectly normal on my stable dose. But if my dose is forcibly reduced or worse, eliminated, I will not be ble to get out of bed. Taking a shower will be excruciating. I will be housebound and bedridden with no social life at all. I will go into adrenal fatigue, like I did when my condition first started and my pain was under treated. I had to go to a nephrologist to be worked up for Addison's disease. But under treated pain is what caused my electrolyte disturbance. If that happens again, adrenal failure is a real possibility. I fear for my life.

I have tried everything there is to try and continue trying additional treatments to have greater efficicacy with pain/symptom management, however without the use of opioid pain medication, I would be unable to help others, volunteer in my community and even get out of my house as I am able to now.

Patients like me need access to our medications as prescribed by our pain management physicians and by legislating this issue it will only cause undue harm to myself and to hundreds of thousands of patients like me who are merely seeking some semblance of normalcy and pain relief. We are not addicts - we do not enjoy having to take opioid pain medications (or any medication for that matter). We have a medical need that requires the use of a medication that is specifically made to treat our pain, and as such we should not be penalized for the actions of addicts who incidentally are also chronically ill with a brain disease but whose issues are separate and unrelated to that of chronic pain patients. It is not our faults that these people are abusing opioid medications, any more than if they were abusing heart medication or insulin for those patients who are chronically ill. Please don't confuse these issues and please don't make the lives of chronic pain patients any more difficult than they already are. What we are asking for is a human right - the right to be adequately treated for our medical conditions which includes the use of opioid medications at a dosage and strength as deemed medically necessary by our treating physicians.

 However, I have a few concerns.  First, I am very concerned about how methadone or transdermal equivalents would be calculated. It would be completely inappropriate/unethical to use a calculation designed to calculate recommended methadone/fentanyl dose from the morphine dose, and then use it to calculate morphine equivalents from the methadone.  That is unequivocally and absolutely a one-way calculation, and you would kill someone if you use it to convert someone the other direction.  A simple 2:1 conversion is probably reasonable for methadone, with fentanyl 100mcg/hr converting to approx 120mg MME,certainly no more than 180mg.

  As far as limits, I agree that few non-cancer patients should be receiving more than 90mg oral morphine equivalent per day chronically.  I consider that a ""soft limit"" for chronic non-cancer pain.  However, the bulk of the literature supports a hard limit a) only for chronic non-malignant pain, and b) at TWICE the CDC guidelines (180MME.)  I strongly support having a ""soft limit"" at 90MME and a ""hard limit"" at 180MME for non-cancer pain, but strongly oppose a ""hard limit"" at 90MME.  Not to mention all the potential ways this could cause severe suffering or problems if managed strictly,(despite your recommended precautions,) such as if we tried to switch to a different opioid mid-month, or they need some additional prn for an acute exacerbation, and cannot receive it because they are at the 90mg limit..

Finally, while i strongly support discouraging benzodiazepines in any way we can, I would advise moving cautiously on gabapentin, and NOT trying to limit it to FDA approved indications.  High quality literature reviews demonstrate clinically significant benefits in a variety of neuropathic pain syndromes, and even limited evidence for chronic low back pain (although also limited evidence of harms in that case.)   If you do try to limit it, PLEASE don't take away effective strategies just because they aren't FDA approved!!!  
Carisoprodol is another problematic enabler drug, as are IV promethazine and diphenhydramine.
 
one thing that would be very helpful but potentially impractical is to try to encourage prescribing practices that result in more steady opioid blood levels. Analgesia depends on CNS level, while euphoria/dysphoria (cravings) are associated with rate of rise or fall.  So steady opioid levels result in improved physical pain when appropriate, without provoking euphoria/dysphoria.  So lower more frequent PRN opioids, scheduled SR opioids, and avoiding IV bolus opioids are all beneficial strategies.

The 7 day limit is great for 90% of acute pain situations.  However, there are also situations where the individual will predictably need pain medications for 2-4 weeks so that could impose a hardship, since many of those patients will be predictably in pain yet have great difficulty getting any more med..  

Personally, I don't see the need for most palliative or hospice patients to use much more opioids than their non-palliative counterparts with similar diagnoses, but there are some patients, such as chronic ischemia, where they would need very high doses.    
I am glad to see there are exceptions allowed, but how difficult are these for us to obtain for our patients?  If we can put the reason for the exception on the script, that would be ideal for us, at least for more straightforward exceptions.

I am very concerned about the quality of your data.  I have already received a notice from an intermediary that I was potentially prescribing too high a dose of opioid despite the fact that this was an active cancer patient, receiving cancer therapy!  If you start cutting off cancer patients from their pain meds, then you probably deserve to get cancer yourself!

I would think all the MRI's and all the Dr reports throughout  the last 15 yrs would be enough to prove my innocence . Throughout the yrs it has been noted several times , no drug seeking behavior and always compliant with Pain contract  would be enough to prove i am not an addict. People in pain don't get high on pain meds . People in pain take their medication as directed. Addicts take it all at once. The Heroin Fentynal crisis is happening because its cheap and releives pain.  Addicts will always find a way to get high. Taking medication from responsible Pain patients is torture. Do i not have a right to have my pain treated by my physician who spent 8 yrs learning how to treat it ? Or by my primary physician who is familiar with my medical history . 

I was diagnosed with 5 Cerebral  Aneurysms and facing brain surgery las March when the insurance company's paid Liar (Dr) decided my medications needed to be cut down even though i made everyone involved aware of my condition and impending surgery. The stress from increased pain and the news about the aneurysms  made me want to give up. 
I had the surgery in March which didnt go as planned , but i made it through it .  
I still spend my days trying to get some kind of pain relief and barely making it thru the day. if i was an addict i would be dead by now from using Heroin cut with Fentynal or other street drugs.

I am a palliative care nurse practitioner and have also worked in oncology as a nurse practitioner.  Both of these special  populations often require greater than 90 MMEs/day to control chronic cancer related pain, as well as potentiator medications to minimize pain by pharmacologically altering pain pathways that narcotics don't always touch.  I believe in and utilize good prescribing practices as taught in REMS education for prescribers. I also agree with a 7 day supply (or less) for acute pain patients or opioid naive patients.  Patients with chronic cancer related pain need access to more than a 7 day supply of drugs at any one time.  Many of these patients are unable to get to the clinic to get another prescription and cannot afford weekly copays for their drugs.  As a provider, having to write prescriptions weekly for my patients would clog up my waiting room and my schedule and make my productivity plummet.  It is not unusual for a cancer patient with chronic, cancer related pain to require 300-400 MMEs a day to keep the pain to a level where they can have some semblance of comfort, utilizing both long and short acting opioid preparations; it is good pain management practice to use both types of narcotics.  On pages 215-216 duplicative LA drugs are mentioned as being flagged, for example, Methadone 10 mg tablets and Methadone 5 mg tablets.  Methadone is not a drug that can be increased rapidly, either by time or dose.  Therefore, a patient on 10 mg of Methadone twice a day, needing a higher dose, should not go to a double dose, ie 20 mg twice a day; rather, a 15 mg dose twice a day would be the most reasonable, but this would not be allowed according to the proposed regulations.  The same could be said for extended release morphine, especially in the initial use of it, when a patient might need 2 different strength tablets to make up a correct dose, ie 30 mg tab and 15 mg tab.  One way around this is to use more of the smaller mg tabs, but for some patients pill burden is a problem, so the fewer number of pills the better to make up a dose.  Cancer and other palliative care/hospice patients should not be penalized for inadequate pain control because of abuse of these drugs in other settings.  We all know there is abuse in the cancer population as well and I've been taken advantage of in the past.  But please, please considering amending these regulations for people who are terminally ill and need their pain meds and adjuncts to maintain some quality of life.

"721","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Dear to whom it may concern,

My personal comment is as follows; I strongly appose this suggested policy, of reducing medical coverage for medicaid/ medicare recipients of Doctor prescribed opioid pain medication over 90 mg (morphine equivalent) a day. This is a dangerous and unethical overreach by a Government agency, into the medical care of an individual. It directly interferes with the Doctor/ Patient relationship. A Doctor who knows a patients medical history and medical needs, should not be interfered with. 

The CDC Guidelines, were meant to be just that, guidelines. To quote Debra Houry, MD, Director of the CDC's National Center for injury Prevention, which oversaw the guidelines. She states ""The guideline is a set of voluntary recommendation intended to guide a primary care provider as they work in consultation with their patients to address chronic pain"". 
This does not replace the expertise of a physician, if they find an individuals dose is beneficial over the 90 mg a day. 

Typically a chronic pain patient has taken a very long and painful journey to get to a point of trying opioids to begin with. After all else has failed. After function of life was bleak, caring for oneself was too much.There are hundreds of thousands of pain warriors in the United States. Some with private insurance, some with medicaid/ medicare. Many ill patients are on medicaid/ medicare because of disabilities pertaining to chronic pain. This is in fact why they are currently on this medical program. 

To remove coverage of a medication to a chronic pain patient who was stable and functioning on a dose above 90 mg a day, is immoral, unethical and discriminatory. For many it is the only way they can care for themselves on a daily bases. 

It is understood now, that some patients metabolic systems work faster than others. What is a high dose for one patient, may not be for another. It should be a common practice to test for this metabolite. Some diabetics need more insulin than other diabetics. Some depressed patients need far greater strength anti depressants than other patients. 

To isolate ""Pain"" due to a chronic illness and cherry pick this, as a highlight to remove coverage is a human rights violation. Unrelenting chronic pain can shut down the body, can cause a slow death and failures of systems including the brain. It does and can cause brain damage. Northwestern University 2008, Chronic pain harms the Brain. 

This would also be a violation of the ADA. Disabled Americans should have access to proper medical care, regardless if they have a disability pertaining to chronic pain. See DOJ Regulations written in 2016. Begin with 35.106 Notice. 

There is currently a civil war on pain patients. A cancer patient is not logically in more pain than another painful life long condition. Each person is unique and each patients systems work differently. That is the highlight of medical care and by removing a life line to a chronic pain patient without any medication currently equal, who has tried almost all other modalities or all of them, is medical neglect. It is discriminatory towards a certain medical recipient (medicaid/ Medicare) who have disabilities, are lower income, are old, are sick and who need ongoing proper care. 

The environment towards chronic pain patients is the worst it has ever been in modern history. The CDC constructed these ""guidelines"" behind closed doors, without public input and without pain specialist. There were plenty of addiction specialist behind these guidelines. Even still, these are not law, because that is when we as a nation enter a dictatorship. 

Please consider the plight of the chronic pain warrior. I am one. I do not need that high of a dose, but many of my pain friends may down the line. Any one person never knows when it could be themselves, or that of a loved one who will be fighting debilitating chronic pain someday. It could last a few weeks, it could last years, it could be a lifetime. Our conditions worsen. Do not take a human right to live, away from honest and responsive, responsible churn pain patients. You hold many lives in your hands. 

This should be between a patient and a Doctor.

Unfortunately, they haven't. I have needed the last resort option of ongoing opioid medication to remain a productive and contributing member of my family and society. Like the millions of other Americans with chronic pain, I don't use opioids out of a psychological need. Rather, I have physiological conditions that benefit significantly from this class of medication.

Opioids have pros and cons like every other medication, but they're reasonable and sometimes the only significant source of relief. And, because of a phenomenon called rapid tolerance, I need higher doses than ""normal.""

I understand that you are putting a cap on the daily MME.

The American Academy of Pain Physicians, the specialists who know about this, recommend against a hard cap. They know that there are so many factors that go into determining an adequate dose for any given patient: cause and degree of pain, metabolism, weight, medical history, duration one has been receiving opioid therapy, effecting tolerance among other concerns.

Please listen to the professional association that knows best how to handle these medications and how to treat pain.

Not only is your proposed going to harm law-abiding pain patients, but it's not going to address the issue of opioid overdose and abuse.

The 2010 Cochrane report on this topic showed the mean risk of addiction was less than 3%. Even more to the point, dose doesn't significantly correlate to risk of addiction. Further, while the government continues to restrict opioids to legitimate pain patients, overdose deaths increase. Why? Because the opioids causing these deaths aren't coming from physicians or pharmacies, but from illicit producers targeting people on the streets.

The overdose deaths from opioids are not at the hands of doctors, most of whom are underprescribers rather than overprescribers these days. The pendulum has swung in the other direction. Pain patients are being deprived of care and no one is benefiting. The crackdown on prescribing has already been underway. Target the drug cartels, not the well monitored pain patients who benefit from opioids enough to regain control of their lives and contribute to society.

Depriving law-abiding chronic pain patients of adequate doses for pain reduction isn't going to save anyone's life. And, inadequate pain relief, will certainly risk the lives of pain patients life  the quality and very potentially the quantity. 
Can you imagine living in unremitting pain? Know that my story could just as easily be yours. 

Who would you want determining your ceiling dose? Your doctor who knows your needs, history, metabolism, condition, etc. or someone who has never met you and knows nothing about your case.

I only get to live once, so, please, don't consign me to an unproductive life, just because of your wrong-headed policies. Enacting this will surely result in fewer doctors treating pain effectively for us patients who need the last resort of opioids. It will also mean more people needing to go on disability due to inadequate pain control and very likely more suicides.

"727","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Please treat people of all ages, with chronic pain conditions, with the dignity and respect they deserve. Be part of treating patients humanely, not inhumanely. Animals are treated with compassion. Humans with these conditions are just as vulnerable. Yes, I have had a chronic pain condition for 5 years, due to a fall. The fall was not my fault. The house didn't have a railing, nor the porch light on (burnt out bulb). I missed a step, while walking down what I thought was a one step exit. I sustained a labral hip tear, which required surgery, and a Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, which is irreparable. My life changed drastically from this point, devastatingly so. ALL activity increases the constant pain, as does walking, standing and sitting. So I avoid these activities, which means I'm primarily housebound and I need to lay with my SI Joint straight and in alignment, without pressure on it. I went to my niece's wedding by lying on my side in an anti-gravity chair, with pillows in the indentation, because I need the flat surface. Prior to this injury at age 55, I worked full-time as an RN for 30 years. Often working additionally, for Agencies and Foat Pools, for extra money and to stay busy. I was athletic all my life, and had a Jr. College volleyball scholarship offered to me when I was 18. However, I declined it because I did not want to move to Montana. I danced and ran, biked along Lake Michigan's bike path in Chicago, and worked out regularly from 27 yrs. old. You can imagine how devastating it was to be forced to give it all up, because P.T. increases my pain.  The Pain Dr. I see has decreased the dosage more than half and I went through withdrawal symptoms and increased pain, but I've stabilized now. If you vote to decrease dosages to 90 Morphine Equivalents, that will not be enough to manage my constant, debilitating pain. The dosage I take just covers it now and there aren't legal alternatives in the State of WI and I can't manage a move, either physically nor financially, to a State which has legal medical marijuana. I don't know if that would even be an effective alternative for me. Kratom is not an alternative for me. I am allergic to it. I've done research on the so called Opioid Crisis. It is NOT a crisis within the community of patients with prescribed opioids. The DEA's website even states that China is duplicating oxycodone tablets for the Black Market, with Fentanyl laced tablets. They've bought the pill press on the Black Market to make the pills look exactly like the authentically manufactured pill from a regulated pharmacy. The fatal overdoses are from THESE pills bought illegally, along with illicit Heroin. Heroin, which the DEA states, is laced with Fentanyl. THESE are the drugs that are killing people. Drug addicts, or people in pain, who have to buy the pills illegally.  Please do not make life even more difficult for us by mandating a cap dosage. Everyone requires an individually, doctor prescribed dose. It is unethical to make humans suffer in pain. It is unethical and against the doctor's Hippocratic Oath, for Insurance companies, or Medicare, to mandate what a patient's Opioid dose should be.  Do you think we CHOOSE to live a life where taking opioids is necessary for quality of life?  We deserve to live however, and choose to live life, to the best if our abilities. We may not contribute to society the way we used to financially, but I DID for 40 years and still would be, if I was capable of it. I try every day to build strength and endurance, so that I can go to a family function, driven by my husband, while I'm reclining in the passengers seat. I bring a beach lounge chair to functions, so that I can lay on my side at the gathering. Remember, I can't sit or stand too long. A pain pill helps me take the shower and get dressed. I apply makeup in my reclining position. Another pain pill will allow me to go to the event for awhile. When I get home, I need the pain pill to get up the stairs to my bed. These outings often cause a Pain Flare, because painful spasms strengthen in intensity. Rest and lying on my sides for several days, along with as needed muscle relaxants and pain medication, help me recover from the outing, so that I can once again putz around the house, a bit. I can't cook like I used to love to. Bacon and eggs, with the help of my husband, once every 2-3 weeks. No, I eat many frozen yogurt bars, because cooking entails the standing & sitting, which increase my pain. So if you decrease the pain medication, I suppose I wouldn't even be able to do what I can now. Listen, you do not have the right to dictate medical care and subsequent quality of life for people.  I contributed all of my life to the goodness, and health and wellness of my family, myself and the patients and their families I engaged with on a regular basis, in high profile administrative nursing positions. Please, I implore of you, to vote against these proposed policies dictate mandated caps and costs.

As referenced in the article, untreated pain changes the brain and it may take even larger doses in the future to achieve relief, and it may not respond at all.

But the government is not protecting us and worse, they are causing us harm. The CMS proposed restrictions of opioid dosages will harm many people. Some patients require a higher dose due to genetic malabsorption defects, some due to rare and difficult to treat conditions that cause severe, intense, unrelenting pain. I have Adhesive Arachnoiditis, a debilitating, progressive, inflammatory condition of the spine that causes severe, intractable pain. There may come a time when I require an opioid dosage that exceeds this limit. But if this restriction goes into effect, it is unlikely I will receive the necessary dosage. Instead I will suffer intensely, needlessly, become home and bed bound, and possibly choose to end my life rather than endure such agony. You have no business interfering with my doctor patient relationship and with my ability to receive appropriate medical care! I realize you will object, and say there are exceptions made through the preauthorization process. But that will be a huge deterrent for most physicians. It demands extra time from them, time they don't have and time equals money. They can pay staff to handle the pre-auth process, but that also requires money. This alone will discourage many physicians. Instead they will take the easy route and lower their patient's dosage, even when its not the appropriate medical care and may actually cause patient harm. The only people who will have to live with the outcome of these restrictions are the patients. The patient is left out of this equation. The patient will have no say in the matter, no say in the quality of their own life. And if they attempt to seek another physician to prescribe their needed dose, they face being ""red flagged"" or labeled as a ""drug seeker"". They can be blackballed and entirely abandoned by the medical community. It's already happening to many. We have become hostages and pawns to the ""Opioid Epidemic"".  Also, many physicians will see this as the government setting a standard acceptable opioid dose, therefore prescribing outside this dose could bring unwanted attention on them and their license from the DEA. The DEA is already targeting legitimate physicians, like renowned pain expert, Dr Forrest Tennant. They are creating widespread fear and panic among doctors. This fear has already caused many physicians to stop prescribing pain medications, regardless of what their individual patients need. This ""one size fits all"" medicine never works. Nobody would accept dose restrictions placed on insulin or blood pressure medication. And yet, this is becoming standard practice for treatment of pain. This is unfair and unscientific. It is an attack on chronic pain and intractable pain patients and discrimination. It's inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The CDC data has shown that prescription opioids have plummeted, while deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl continue to skyrocket. There is no Opioid Epidemic. There is only a Heroin and Illicit Fentanyl Epidemic! And now there's a pain refugee epidemic and pain crisis. These measures will only make it worse. The government is still trying to fix the problem by controlling doctors and pharmacists and restricting pain medications, even though that's not the source of the problem. This may be an easier target than drug cartels and illegal drugs from China sent via USPS, but it will not save a single drug addict. On the other hand, it may cause chronic pain patients to commit suicide. I doubt that this is the outcome anyone is hoping for, but all evidence indicates that it will be. The VA recently released statistics that showed veterans forced off opioids have an increased incidence of suicide, not overdose from illegal drugs. The overwhelming data shows that this measure will hurt many, and help few, if any. Pain patients in this country are being victimized and treated like addicts and criminals, and now the CMS wants to join in. Many have already faced forced tapers and elimination of pain medications. They have been demonized by society and abandoned by the medical community, and now our government. Many are suffering complications from under treated and untreated pain, like heart attacks, stroke and adrenal failure. I've suffered adrenal fatigue from under treated pain. It's a very serious health problem. It's hard for me to understand why my government would contribute to causing these complications on elderly and disabled Americans. And sadly, many intractable pain patients are choosing suicide. These proposed changes are irresponsible and cruel. The only positive outcome will be the government will save money. And many believe that is the driving force. But using the heroin and illicit fentanyl epidemic as camouflage to cut costs on vulnerable patients is reprehensible. Please don't do this! Please protect intractable pain patients.

While I do everything I can to be healthy and push through my multitude of limitations, from acupuncture (self-pay) to daily walks and dancing several times a week (yes, one can have joy in one's life with proper pain management), I also rely on narcotics. I don't take large doses of the Vicoden and Carisoprodol but I plan my days around taking meds every 3-4 hours, with food, lots of planning, but this avoids the worst of the pain spikes. Though pain spikes do occur, and with the tight restrictions on the number of pills I can have in a month, I have nothing extra to take for a pain spike. I may be reduced to using heat or ice and just rest; cancel the rest of my day. Which is very annoying and difficult to accept. 
My doctor knows me best. He has been my PCP for 30 years. Even he is frustrated with the hoops I have to now jump through. I have to see him every 3 months. I can't call in a prescription, have to make an extra trip to the health center, and may be asked for a urine sample. How many legislators would be happy to have a plastic pee cup put in your hand at random moments and told to go and pee on demand? Then tested for every legal and illegal drug known to exist? It is a humiliating thought, isn't it?
With the first of the year, there were changes made to MassHealth and none of my scrips were acceptable. I had to call and call and wait and wait because some intermediary agency (OptumRx) didn't think I needed these scrips. My doctor called multiple times. My doctor! Isn't he the one who knows me and knows my chronic health issues and cares for me? Apparently his voice wasn't enough. A pharmacist or administrator was making MY medical decisions??? I had to BEG to get my scrips filled. The way OptumRx was doing things, I was cut off, with no warning at all, to go cold turkey, without pain meds. That could have put me in the hospital or in my grave. Suicide is common when people in chronic pain can't get their pain under control. That is the behind the scenes fall out of the so-called opioid crisis. Especially when someone knows that their pain meds make their lives bearable, and the notion, or worse, the reality, that they were being denied their pain meds, yes, it can lead to suicide. Hopelessness. I spent hours on the phone, over many days, to get this straightened out. I was told that this would happen at the first of the year, each year. Then it happened again in February. I have limited energy to get through my day. THIS is not something I need.
Nor do I need to hear that CMS is considering tightening availability even more. Chronic pain patients hopefully have smart and attentive doctors.

The pain is unimaginable and the injury cannot be repaired. It will never EVER heal. I did not choose to life a life of suffering. It was caused by a negligent medical provider who violated my consent and recklessly assaulted me under anesthesia. The injuries he inclicted caused me to have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, often called the suicide disease, because the pain is ranked on the McGuill Pain Index as worse than cancer, amputation and childbirth. 
There is NO cure for CRPS and mainstay treatments include long term opioid therapy. 
14 surgeries to date have been attempted to reduce the pain. Two attempts with a spinal cord stimulator have failed.
ALL alternative treatments have failed including acupuncture, massage, PT, biofeedback, scrambler therapy, talk therapy, and more. All of these alternative treatments have also cost me thousands in out of pocket expenses as insurance would not reimburse any of the costs. 
My internal organs have become compromised with extreme gastro intestinal motility issues, exotropia in my eye, cardiac episodes... The list goes on and on but most of, the daily pain is sheer torture with no relief in sight. 

The only mild improvement I get to function at a minimal level has been with the long term opioids prescribed by my trusted and licensed pain management provider. He is the one and only medical specialist I consult for opioids, and I follow his instructions to a T. It is medically necessary for me to continue using opioids in an effort to participate in society and reduce my pain form a constant 8/10.

What am I to do with regarding my medical care my medical care with the regulations you are imposing?

My quality of life depends on opioids I rely upon opioid medications. These prescription medically necessary pills reduce my incurable pain, allow me to function better and play an important role for my family and children.

What reliable science can you provide that supports your regulations? There is none!

I fear that I will need to see even more doctors to treat my pain which will cause even more charges to Medicare. I will continue to remain on SS disability. 
I have already undergone 14 surgeries in an attempt to improve my non-healing injury -- how many more can I tolerate?

Your proposals ""mandate a dangerous, unfounded and medically unethical intrusion into medical practice by third parties operating without face to face knowledge of the patient. 

I am among the very few pain patients who EVER display diagnostic symptoms of opioid use disorder.

Over-regulation of prescribing is already harming hundreds of thousands of stable patients coerced into opioid doses below therapeutic levels. Mandated VA restrictions on opioid prescribing are directly responsible for hundreds of deaths among veterans
Forcing pain patients to go through an ""exceptions"" process before extending prescriptions beyond seven days is inappropriate and dangerous nonsense. 

There is no one-size-fits-all patient or treatment plan. 

CMS should stand down from attempting to force restrictions on medical practice which have such predictable and horrid consequences. 

Please allow my trusted and licensed pain management providers to do their job and provide me prescriptions for any and all of the medications required to treat my injury and improve my life.
MY life depends on it and will sink into an even deeper hole with increased opioid restrictions.

I am now mad.  Did we have a problem with opioids being over prescribed,  YES. Whose fault really doesn't matter, it happened.  Then you said oh no, we have a problem we have to fix it starting in 2014.   But you were the ones that started the opioid crisis.  Closing pill mills and pain centers and every family dr afraid to prescribe medicine .Did you even think about what was going to happen to their patients when you shut them down? You left them in withdrawal with no where to turn.  What did you expect would happen? I believe you knew, they would turn to streets, and if you didn't then SHAME ON YOU,  and why are you making decisions like that without thinking what the outcome would be.  Yes I have to drive 100 miles every 28 days and pay $125.00 for script.  2 weeks later I get a procedure, 2 weeks later 200 more miles for script.  I get a procedure every 6 wks.  It is a vicious cycle of pleasing you, the government.  You created this mess with no regard for the people who are truly in pain.  Is all pain the same?  My Dr says no but you set limits without my medical records, so I guess it is.  Thank you for letting China and drug dealers treat us with fentynal laced pain pills. or better yet let's get some with elephant sedatives in it. It has been 4 years,sure there are probable a couple of Drs who slipped under your radar but why are there all these terrible drugs on the street that will kill, and you are going after Drs that may have 1 patient that dies and they are dropping like flies on street.  Why did you not care what would happen to me when my Dr. said I quit because he was tired of not being able to treat me and worrying he was going to do something that might get him put in jail.  How can I feel safe with you making my medical decisions when you didn't realize you can't just stop opioids without  tapering off your pain pills or you go into withdrawal and may die?   Oh wait you knew that because you are fighting addiction and are working on setting up places for addicts on the street to detox.  Oh and let's not  to forget the 400.00 urine test at various times.  I have enough in my retirement savings to last another year, maybe.  Shame on you for making people be treated worse than my dog is treated when I take him to vet.  At least they have the option of euthanasia without being counted as another overdosed opioid user for a little chart.  Shame on you for no empathy for the pain patient.  Someday you will have surgery and be denied pain medicine to stop the pain, or you may break a major bone and get an anti- inflammatory because you go to a pain clinic so you are now an addict and no longer a person that has any rights or feelings.  Maybe you will be treated like a drug addict and denied the right to have your script filled cause they don't like your looks. Take an aspirin, tough it out.  I bet that won't happen to you cause you know how to live your life in pain.  When is someone going to realize pain medicine used correctly saves lives.  There have always been illegal drugs and you went after drug pusher not the Doctors.  I am ashamed that people are killing themselves because they cannot tolerate the pain any longer and they were denied help. Maybe if they had gone to streets and purchased drugs illegally someone would care enough to help.   Open your eyes, listen to the other side of the story.  I worked like a dog in a factory for 33 years, subjected to dangerous chemicals.  I am old and broken but I have to take care of my home and sick husband.  Why do I have to suffer in pain because other people overdosed.  Get the people dealing illegal drugs that kill people and let my Dr do his job without fear of going to jail when he has followed all the rules also.  I am sure his life is hell.  You have basically told my Dr his medical training was wasted and you are now my DR.  I don't know why anybody would go to this degree to get rid of legal opiades with most people dying from  drugs off the street.  Pain pills are to stop pain.  I am so afraid I will have to have surgery and the thoughts  of doing that terrifies me because they are withholding meds for surgery.  I do not understand why pain is all of a sudden good.

Currently the decision is based on small denominators (less than 30 member-years). However, these medications are gaining wide spread use in the population, especially with changes in treatment guidelines and reversal products. There is a large risk with not considering this adherence measure which is the patient safety. Unlike the other adherence measures, stroke risk within this population that utilizes NWOA (also known as DOACS) is extremely high and a high burden to health care if patients are not treated appropriately. Simply starting patients on these medications without adherence reinforcement may cause our health care system to see a rise in morbidity due to rising stroke rates.

If You take away opioids from your patients, not only will You be making an incorrect value judgement which states that people, if given the chance, will become delinquent. You are taking away the *only* class of medication left to patients like me, who cannot (WOULD LIKE TO BUT IT IS NOT SAFE TO) take NSAID medications. i have CRPS/RSD, Degenerative Disk, Sciatica from FBSS, Fibromyalgia, Ebstein-Barr Virus, and other pain-causing disorders/conditions, including having had a mistake made in my Permanent SCS installation. My Barrett's Esophagus, GERD, Gastric Inflammation, and stomach-lining issues are only part of what my body deals with.

I firmly believe that CPPs should be allowed to take whatever their doctors and they agree works safely and legally for them, and that MMJ and Kratom should be legal in all 50 States.

It is wonderful that Lyrica and Neurontin help the people that they help, but what about those of us who have a prohibiting side effect to them? What about the same for Amytriptaline? 

HERE is the *fundamental* problem: Chronic Pain Patients *may* have similarities, but ARE ALSO *individual* organisms, having *individual* characteristics. When we know that opiod-RELATED fatalities does not equal opioid-CAUSED fatalities, we need to look at a society that is somehow, obviously flawed. Why has there not a distinction been made re: this by the CDC?

Drug addicts need some kind of help; clearly that is true! But Chronic (Intractable, in my case) Pain Patients need NOT to be punished and left unable to function, as well. Yes? Yes!

If a vast number of CPPs were able to function better, we would be able to increase the Gross Nation Product!

Additionally, I for one, could be working with greater speed to try to *CURE* diseases and disorders, like my own.

I believe that Mathematical Chaos describes it very well--NOT merely the ""Butterfly Effect"" concept, but the actual ""chaotic"" character of its flares. Beyond this, i might be able to prove this hypothesis were I not in too much pain to do so. Maybe in idiopathic channelopathies?) 

While in great pain, I often can't cook, bathe, do laundry, or go shopping.

I have had RSD/CRPS for ca. 25 years, and I am not ready to give up on being compassionately productive. Are You?

My wife is a high dose opioid patient.  She been under treatment for the past 27 years.
Your proposed changes will probably ruin our lives.
If the proposed changes are implemented then it  looks like she will have an even more difficult time finding a doctor who will prescribe the medication she is currently taking and doing quite well given that she is an intractable pain patient.
And, if she can find a doctor, then her Medicare Advantage insurance company will either not cover her prescriptions or will make the co-pay prohibitive.
She is not alone.  You are about to impact about 1 million intractable pain patients and their families.
Did you consider what you are going to do to the lives of close to a million high dose opioid patients? 
I haven't been able to find any studies that indicate that your plan will reduce the number of patients who become addicted to opioids.
I think you are solving a non-problem and, probably, will result in a lot of suicides by people who have their treatment terminated in a cruel and unusual way.
Please let doctors be doctors.   If you find a bad doctor then fix that problem but don't destroy a million lives with a broad brush.

I currently have private insurance, but will rely on Medicare/Medicaid in a couple of years. I was 1st diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder at age 20. Since then I have been diagnosed with lupus, scleroderma, CREST syndrome, gastric motility disorders, esophageal spasms/motility, chronic osteomyelitis, repeated stress fractures, degenerative arthritis, tendenosis, shoulder & Achilles, rheumatoid arthritis/osteomyelitis arthritis, hands, k was, chest, back, jaw, papal edema, optic neuritis, fibromyalgia, degenerative disks, endomitriosos, fibroids etc.  I have tried adoring, Tylenol, Motrin, numerous other inbuprophen , lyrica, physical therapy, heat, ice. Tes unit, lecithin, flaxseed,relaxation, strength/stretching, breathing techniques, etc etc. prior to opioids. All medication, natural or techniques failed to control my pain as a result I had extremely limited ability to live a productive life. I could not care for my child because of the awful pain I life with.   I cannot work, stand or walk for any length of time without severe pain. Only thing that has helped is opioid therapy. Without opioid therapy my life would be filled with indescribable pain. Because of the opioids I take, under strict guidelines from my doctor-which I have Never not explicitly  followed. I signed a contract with my pain doctor and I am 100% compliant.  I randomly have my urine tested and have never never failed a test.  Again,I am 100% compliant I can care for my family, my elderly mom, cook and clean my home.  While I cannot do those tasks endlessly-because opioids do not take away my pain completely. They reduce my pain enough to improve my quality of life enough that I can have a decent quality experience. I use opioid therapy only because all other treatments have failed to control my pain.nothing else has controlled my pain so that I could have a decent quality of life. I wish I did not have chronic illness or chronic pain/but I do- I am thankful there is medication (opioids) to help me when all else has failed. If government takes opioids away my pain will become intolerable and hardly worth living. Doctors are already scared when they are doing nothing wrong. Only fulfilling their oath to help and cause no pain. Forcing doctors to stop prescribing opioids will destroy my life-and many others. Forcing limits on opioids makes it an awful hardship for chronic pain patients who are already struggling. If opioid are stopped other medical problems will become worse. My blood pressure goes up when I'm in pain. That puts me at increased risk for a stroke or heart attack. I do not Ever use alcohol and have never taken any medications that was not specifically prescribed to me by my doctor. I go to one pain management dr, get all pain medication prescriptions from him and use 1 pand have for years. I go to one pharmacy for my medicine. If government removes opioid from my treatment plan I guarantee my life will deteriorate. All to punish me and other chronic pain patients for the relatively few people have abuse opioids. Government needs to stay out out of the doctor patient relationship, before they harm far more people than they will ever help!  Prescription opioids, legally prescribed by doctors to help chronically ill patient are not causing a drug problem. The opioid problem in this country is caused by illegal opioids, heroin, and fentanyl brought into this country illegally. Our government needs to stop the illegal drug trade if we want to solve drug abuse, not go after chronically ill, chronic pain patients who are only trying to live a decent life.

"743","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My wife is a chronic pain patient, diagnosed with trigeminal neuropathic pain, hemifacial spasms, blepharospasms, and cerebral adhesive arachnoiditis. Trigeminal neuralgia pain is considered one of the most painful conditions known to medicine and is characterized by excruciating pain in the head, eye, and face. In a 15 year time frame, she has exhausted all medical treatments and procedures. Since it is a rare condition, there are no specific medications for this condition and due to its progressive nature, her pain has worsened as she gets older.  Additionally, there are no medications available on the market that stop hemifacial spasms and blepharosphasms, which severely limit her vision and exacerbates the trigeminal pain. 

Due to her unique circumstances, my wife takes the same dose of Nucynta ER every day for 4 years. Currently, it is near impossible to find this medication in 2018 and fill it every month- forcing us to drive around to different pharmacies to find one that has the medication in stock (no other option than trigger another red flag at no fault of our own). Additionally, she have been forced to take a lower dose due to limited number of pills available- resulting in a very poor outcome and management of pain.

The newly proposed regulation of denying patient's access to their medication above 90MME is egregious and directly impacts care for pain patients.  She relies on pain medication to get through the day to manage incurable pain.  Reduced dosage of medication prevents her from washing face, brushing teeth, talking, smiling, showering, getting out of bed and sleeping.  CMS Medicare continues to encourage different entities to practice medicine without a medical degree. This particular proposal disrupts the doctor / patient relationship and gives insurance companies the right to arbitrarily deny medication management to its chronic pain patients based solely on the MME dosage.  There is no scientific research to support a hard cut off at the arbitrary 90 MME, despite current scientific understanding of patient's intervariability of hepatic opioid metabolism genes.   

Transfer of power to insurance companies, will empower for-profit companies to override doctors' treatment plan, ensuring inhumane treatment of chronic pain for the sickest and most vulnerable Americans (both civilian and veterans).  However, where will regulators draw the line on insurance companies making final treatment decisions despite doctors' recommendations based on years of schooling and experience.  We are systematically stripping away a physicians ability to provide quality medical care and appropriate treatment decisions.  Even if an override option is available to doctors, if insurance companies have the final say in medication management, most companies will be more concerned with saving money than the quality of life of a chronic pain patient.  

With even more hoops to jump through, chronically ill pain patients will encounter even more roadblocks and red tape. Chronic pain patients like feel beaten down by a system that does not care about their well being, profiles them as addicts, and feel that CMS Medicare, insurance, DOJ, and DEA are more concerned with punishing those that use opioid pain medication than the right of a chronic pain patient's access to proper pain medication even when taken as directed.

This policy proposal is a continuation of regulations that force more doctors away from treating chronic pain patients, will force more patients to schedule ineffective surgical procedures and more productive citizens will be disabled. In an attempt to save money on medication, CMS will inadvertently increase cost of caring for these chronic pain patients, costing much more than opioid medications.
  
CMS Medicare, DEA, and DOJ already have blood on their hands, this policy just creates more roadblocks for pain patients and doctors. More doctors will leave pain management practices, creating more pain patient refugees that can't find a physician to continue medical care. For patients, this policy will increase suicides- especially when pain medication is not made available to appropriate chronic pain patients.

All these rules and regulations to protect the addict while no regulation has been put in place to protect a chronic pain patient's right to have access to pain medication management. Stop discrediting the voice and need of chronic pain patient access to medication. Stop linking opioid overdoses to pain medication prescribed by a patient's physician. The fact is that even as opioid prescriptions have decreased, the number of overdoses has increased. Focusing in on limiting pain medication does not stop heroin and fentanyl overdoses.

Until effective medicines are available to replace opioids no one should be forced off working opioid therapies it's unethical. Stop making it harder to access medication doses you should protect elderly from barbaric inhumane treatment. Implementing the CDC Guidelines has caused more deaths & nothing to end drug abuse. Over 120 million people prescribed opioids for chronic pain in 2014 responsibly, without abuse, addiction, didn't sell them & kept out of the hands of children how do you ignore that? Many committed suicide more contemplating planning their suicides. No one should suffer so they plan their deaths the only way to end pain! Everyone's right to medical care is protected except for C.P.patients.  More rules/laws to deny elderly of medicine doses does nothing to stop illegal drug use. End the injustice of 120 million Americans exempt long term patients from the scrutiny & inhumanity of such laws created. Restore doctors ability to practice medicine, not according to a non-specific percentage mandated by the FDA & fear of DEA investigations. Medical decisions must be made by doctor & patient without government limits on individual doses it takes to prevent avoidable decline & death from pain. The only way to make a dent in the Heroin Epidemic is to go after the source, stop victimizing innocent senior medical patients.

In 2008 the Senate heard testimony from pain doctors & pain specialists to determine the consequences of denying pain medications. Dr. Alex Deluca was very explicit as he testified the result was the same as a death sentence. In his testimony he explained people with Chronic Pain would suffer as their bodies slowly failed organ by organ. Heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, increased incidence or worsening of diabetes, not to mention the physical changes in the brain as the body attempted to deal with distress of extreme suffering. Dr. DeLuca even reported that patients denied pain medications would be twice more likely to commit suicide than the national average & it's happening right now. In 2012, Congress conducted similar hearings with a new group of pain doctors & specialists. The conclusions from these experts the same; denial of pain medications is a death sentence to Chronic Pain Patients & you can stop these rules & laws causing death sentences.

Dr. Satel a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute & lecturer at Yale University. Is a vocal opponent of involuntary tapering of controlled opioids.
A renowned author & addiction psychiatrist says ""the efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs & other institutions across the country to taper people off opioids without their consent is ""an outrage.""
""To take a patient who's doing well off of medication abruptly & without their permission is not unfair."" ""I actually think it's malpractice,"" Dr. Sally Satel said. ""I think it is an outrage when you have a person who's doing well on a dose of medication, highly functional & their pain is under good control. This is what you want. This is the clinical outcome.""

What of liberty for all or isn't it for those in pain? What of pain patients state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, inflicting torture of untreated pain not protected from being punished for crimes others committed? End CPpatients abandoned by doctors w/years of stable opioid therapy. Don't allow society beliefs CDC guidelines used as law & now Medicare & Medicaid to be justified in forced suffering of elderly pain patients. I suffer severe pain of the most painful disease known CRPS/RSD to the detriment of my health no choices because of rules/laws never once considered real life effects on people living in hell of unrelieved pain denied continuity of care. Restore proven effective opioid therapies to all patients not finding ways to take it. Fellow human beings depend on you to stop denying our rights.

This threshold is not based on science and does not allow proper management of severe chronic pain. Physicians should have guidance and limitations but this is not an appropriate measure. This measurement does not convert to even minimal effectiveness in other drugs like fentanyl and methadone. Also physicians are already overburdened with requirements of preauthorization for drugs. Medicare certainly knows if its subscribers have cancer or are in hospice. These patients should be exempted from regulated limits with clarity, with clear procedures and with minimal burden to physician and patient. There are other populations with severe chronic pain as well and care must be taken not to send these patients in search of illegal and unsafe heroin. Suboxone is not for pain and is very expensive but is being accepted as substitute for pain medication. It should not be.
Also re. opiates like ocycodone, these pills are now being prescribed to be taken every 6 hours because of the hysteria re. overprescribing. Oxycodone takes a half hour to take effect and wears off after 4 hours. I'm sure that can be found in medical literature but I do not have time to do your job. Opiates and other medications should be written for appropriate and fact based usage directions including duration or frequency; not histrionic and defensive usage instructions.

In 2005 I was in a single car accident which caused back problems. During my visits to my back Doctor and one back surgery I was then told I needed a left hip replacement. After having my hip replaced it was unsuccessful and 13 weeks later they had to do a revision. I was then told there was no problems to be seen. I was still having back problems so I began seeing a different doctor about my back come to find out I had a ruptured disc and needed another back surgery. Note from my hip surgeries I was now in a wheelchair not able to lift my left leg. Now I'm back in the hospital getting a spinal fusion One year from my second hip surgery I went to MUSC to a Orthodontist and found out that the cup installed in my pelvis was in wrong not allowing me to lift my leg. That Dr which was Dr Harry Demos told me that he could fix the cup but could not fix the problems that it has already done to my tendon. Which turned out to be a good surgery it got me out of the wheelchair at that point but I walk with a bad limp. Back to my back again. One year from my Spinal fusion Dr carter removed the rods and screws and added more bone graft meterial. After a year or year and a half I started back problems again. I heard of a excellent back Dr that was the Chief Neurosurgeon at MUSC. I set up an appointment to go visit him. He began running test immediately. Once he received the results he found that the bone graft meterial was a defect and was growing causing my nerve canal to start closing up on my left side. Every year to year and half they have been trying to keep it open. This has caused spinal stenosis and Arachnoiditis. I had my last surgery in December 2017 when the Doctor explained there was no more surgeries that he could do being the nerve canal has closed to much. I have had nerve burning,Steroid injections, have had two different nerve stimulators and have had no relief. Now my only option is a pain management Dr. Which I have been going to for many years. I take a urinalysis test once a month and have not failed one. Now they are taking away our medication which is causing me along with many other people to have no quality of life. It's causing many to turn to street drugs or suicide or live in constant pain and have no quality of life. I have two beautiful grandsons one being 2 and half and the other being 3 and half. I would love to be able to spend good quality time with them as a grandfather. I'm ask you to please revulk the CDC guidelines.

"769","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"The problem with the proposed CMS policy on Opioid Overutilization is that it relies upon payers to regulate 
the prescribing of clinicians.  In doing so, it substitutes the payers' judgment for the clinicians'.  Since payers have 
no therapeutic relationship with the patient, their judgment in these processes is quite arbitrary and based on policy 
algorithms.  While this may intercept inappropriate prescribing in a minority of cases, it will cause patient harm in the 
majority of cases where the prescription is appropriate.  

Such policies have poorly designed mechanisms to reach a laudable goal.  Specifically, the proposal states that ""....we 
expect sponsors [payers] to prospectively manage drug utilization by implementing real-time safety alerts at the time of 
dispensing as a preventive step to ensure prescribers are aware that potentially high risk levels of prescriptions opioids will 
be dispensed to their patients...."".  The disconnect here is that the alert doesn't happen while the clinician is in the act of 
writing the prescription, when he/she might be able to consider a change in the MME.  It happens much later when the patient
 is standing in the pharmacy waiting to have their medication filled.  Most payers are using the point of sale as an 
opportunity to require a prior authorization, thereby creating significant delays in filling prescriptions.  This has led directly 
to patient burden and harm, with patients being forced to pay cash for a covered benefit, or to go without their medication 
and suffer unnecessary pain or withdrawal if they can't afford the cash price.  It also places a significant burden on medical 
practices that have to repeatedly convince payers that their prescribing practices are sound, one prescription at a time.

A better approach would be to eliminate the role of payer-as-enforcer, and require medical practices to demonstrate that 
they have policies and workflows in place to promote safe opioid prescribing; that they are following these policies; and 
that they can show results in terms of low rates of high MME prescribing and the prescribing of dangerous combinations 
(e.g., opioid-benzodiazepine).

Safe opioid prescribing is a clinician responsibility.  Let's treat it as such.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0680","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","David Anisman-UT"

I had practiced as a Registered Nurse with a Masters Degree in Business for over 30 years. During the early years of nursing I worked my share of night shifts and became adept in Labor and Delivery helping 100's of babies make their debut into our world. Rather quickly, after receiving my MBA, I was offered and accepted leadership roles. In my late 30's, early 40's I began noticing pain in my major joints, shoulders and hips, but soldiered on. After all, I was a single mom of two active, athletic children, a boy and a girl. I continued to run and work out 5 days a week. Not long after I, unfortunately, had shoulder surgery. I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that my shoulder looked like that of a 90 year old woman. A few short years later, my right leg began to drag behind me. I saw the same orthopedic physician. Upon X-ray I was told both of my hips were bone on bone and that I needed a joint replacement on my right hip. I was 43 years old. The next year I had my left hip replacement. Over the next few years I had 3 more hip replacements due to prosthetic recalls. My second right hip replacement tore of a good portion of my pelvis. I was faced with having to retire as I could no longer perform my nursing or leadership duties, mostly because I could no longer walk without a cane and the need for pain management. I was 52. Today, I do what I can to maintain a household and have to live with my now adult daughter. I can't get out of bed without first taking pain medication that keeps me connected with my family and with life. I don't pretend to know what life would be like without pain medication. I look forward to the day when I can greet my grandchildren and help my children raise them. I live with the regret of a nursing career cut short. But I am living. But only with the aide of medication that enables me to get out of bed and continue my life. I sadly can't run any longer either, but I am living. I can't imagine what my life would be like if Medicare didn't cover the medication that enables me to tolerate moving through life. Please consider me, and those like me, that are not a part of an opioid epidemic. I can't imagine having to live life from my bed.

"771","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My best friend has struggled with chronic pain from spinal injuries for many years, following eleven spinal surgeries and several additional ones.  With the assistance of several modalities of pain management, e.g., P.T., ablations, epidural injections, as well as pain medications, she did very well for many decades.  My friend's physicians had been impressed throughout by her functioning, in spite of serious injuries. and she was able to work full-time, in spite of  of original predictions that such activity would be impossible. However, she lives in a state that recently passed regulations that limit opioid medications to 90 MME daily,  i.e., approximately 1/3 of the regimen that her physician had carefully tailored to her needs.  Since that reduction, and even with increases in other  modalities, she is now is now in constant, severe pain and has great difficulty concentrating, and so.she had to retire prematurely (and has enrolled in Medicare), and she can no longer participate in caring for her grandchild,  No one observing  my friend could question that now she must seriously consider the need to end her life prematurely.  If Medicare enacts  the proposal to impose a uniform limit on opioid medications to 90 MME daily,  that arbitrary ""criterion"" will certainly become widely accepted by private insurers and by more states.  My friend's physician is deciding whether to go to great trouble to fight the current state restrictions on her med,ications, and he for her; the proposed 90 MME is so insufficient that her physician sees little reason to contest the state limit if Medicare passes the restriction in question. Even if it is theoretically possible for physicians to apply for exceptions, doing so is expected to be time-consuming and to place physicians at (perceived) risk, especially in the current Zeitgeist.  
 .
The Medicare proposal to limit prescriptions will certainly harm countless more patients, like my friend.  Medicare should should leave prescribing to the individual physicians dealing with individual patients.   There are sure to be tragic mistakes due to imposing uniform, involuntary cuts that do little to stop illegal opioids like heroin and illegally produced fentanyl, while risking the lives of  chronic pain patients, like my friend. She has been my best friend since graduate school in the early '70s and I don't want to lose her. Please consider the patients with severe chronic pain and allow doctors to do what is best for them, which may involve significant doses of opioids to make life bearable.

I recognize that opioid addiction is an issue in the US, but in the current climate with intense efforts to limit the possibility of addiction, chronic pain patients are not getting the attention (and more importantly, medication) they need. Chronic pain patients who take medication that is reducing pain and not inducing a high are highly unlikely to develop an addiction and imposing strict limits may have drastic and harmful effects on these people. In your efforts to reduce prescriptions to those that do not need high doses of opioids do no make the mistake of imposing measures that negative affect those with chronic pain. You must be aware that your actions matter to insurer, which tends to affect not only those on madicare, but also how insurers make decisions in the larger market.

I am a Medicare patient and I am a pain patient diagnosed with degenerative disc disease for 6 years and a survivor of cancer and fibromyalgia, heart issues, I am a diabetic,IBS,high blood pressure and gout in both feet and swelling in my arms/hands . I have tried all of the non-opioid treatments and therapies.  I have used injections, PT, OT and many other procedures but they all failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications along with the non-opioid treatments.

Opioids help me by managing my pain and allowing me to have daily function, walking, grocery shopping, cleaning, and more. My healthcare team utilizes both opioid and non-opioid treatments. I do not mix my medications with alcohol or other substances and use exactly as directed. I have been a compliant patient and secure my medications and only use one pharmacy. 

Without the improved function that opioids give me I would be housebound. 
My medical conditions will continue to decrease my ability to function normally as I go through the aging process. Opioid and pain management were only started as a last resort option.

The CDC guidelines were written by non-pain management healthcare professionals and some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome. They have no idea how living with pain affects the whole person, mind, body and spirt. 

These policies will create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, doctors are already scared to treat chronic pain patients and more doctors will opt out of pain treatments. These policies will cause more disability claims, more unemployment which will cause more homelessness and a greater need for social services.

When a pain patient is forced to taper off of opioids, there are huge risks for the patients, such as suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and heart attacks.
I am disabled and my pain medication helps me by stabilizing my pain.
My medical care should be left to my doctors, who understand my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.

A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME will cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain. 

Making new regulations for 7-day supply will not stop the over-doses of those who use illicit heroin and illicit fentanyl that is coming in from other countries. It is already proven that the prescribing of legitimate FDA approved pain medications has been going down for over 5 years while overdoses to illicit drugs is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise from these illicit drugs, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue of legitimate pain medications.

I have already had to write for special authorization to receive pain medication at a dosage REQUIRED to treat the intractable pain that resulted from crushed nerves; this is PERMANENT DAMAGE so limiting the opioid dosage creates a frightening and stressful reality for me, and a professional challenge and disappointment for my doctor as he tries to provide continuity of care for me.  The nerve medications do not work.  Opioids have been necessary to simply lower pain levels to survive and function day to day.  By setting ""standard"" limits on pain dosages, I am already forced to pay out of pocket for a residual balance due because I'm in more pain than the ""standard"" says I should be in.  Now, how do you even call that health care?  Much less so for the disabled on a fixed, low income?  This is America.  We can and should do better than that.

The FDA, the government, and insurance companies need to step away from federal regulations and controlling of health care and what my physicians can prescribe for me to take for my health conditions.  As patients, we have no privacy as it is, but this is taking our health away, and lives are being lost.  You cannot limit everything.  One size does not fit or average all, or even come close.  It is time to step back, let go, and give American citizens back control of their own health care with their own doctors.

Please start putting decent pain physicians and patients who function and have their lives intact on opioid therapy on your panels to help you make decisions about what you will and will not put in place, like this line item at hand.  We must stop the insanity of the political fear climate surrounding opioid dosages.  Talk to patients.  There is an illegal drug problem in this country, but it has very little to do with most Medicare prescriptions from a doctor's office, and this is clearly known.  

I sincerely hope Medicare will stand down and regain common sense on the fake opioid crisis, and set a trend in motion that nothing needs to be limited at the patient level.  No prescription limits are needed between a physician and the patient, as they determine what is being treated - not Medicare or a pharmacy or a stack of surveys!  This is what needs to be voiced on the topic and it is well overdue.  I hope you will be the voice of a new narrative in the news, and make that your new headline:  MEDICARE DEEMS NO PRESCRIPTION OPIOID LIMITS ARE NECESSARY.  You could turn the tide of the entire nation and save thousands of lives.  

People are dying from under treated intractable pain every single day.  Their pain is unbearable and they are taking their lives!  Their medication for pain is being reduced or stopped entirely by a ridiculous CDC Guideline that has been treated with more respect than The Bible.  If you limit pain medication prescriptions and make it that much harder, doctors are going to keep quitting, and more people are going to die.

You DO NOT RECOVER FROM INTRACTABLE PAIN.  It requires lifelong opioid therapy from a caring, experienced physician, and they are already running scared!  If you impose limits on individual pain patient's prescriptions, you are playing Russian roulette with a person's life that is already wracked with intractable pain as it is.  No good thing is accomplished by this.  Would you want your mother's medication limited?  Your son's?  How about your own?  We are all one car accident away from a traumatic injury that could leave YOU with intractable nerve pain.

You and I take for granted being able to walk without pain, sleeping in a bed, lifting items under 25 pounds, sitting for extended periods of time, attending parties and functions, working a full time job.

"787","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm a chronic pain patient with CRPS, Spinal Stenosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, Thoracic Neuralgia, Lumbar Radiculapothy, and Multiple Disc Herniations. Opoid therapy is a part of my treatment plan. I've undergone surgery, countless injections, physical therapy and countless other out of pocket treatments to help control my pain. I've been using opoids responsibly as prescribed by my pain management physician, who evaluates my conditions monthly.

As a Medicare recipient in my 40s I don't have the same medical concerns as someone over 65. Also those of us in the chronic pain community suffer from a variety of diseases and respond to treatments differently, therefore not everyone can be treated at a 90 MME.

Please don't limit my physician's ability to treat me as the individual who I am. Do not try to fit me into a one size fits all treatment plan. Without my current treatment plan I wouldn't be able to get out of bed on most days, fix dinner for my children or complete the basic activities of daily living that you take for granted.

Please don't confuse dependence with addiction. I depend on my medications to live. I depend on them to get out of bed. I depend on them to add to my quality of life. Without appropriate pain control I would be bed or chair bound and would be missing out on my children's lives. These medications take the edge off the pain, I don't get a sense of euphoria. An addict uses drugs to escape life, they experience euphoria because their are no pain receptors for the opoid to attach to.

Please don't limit these life savings medications from legitimate pain patients, who are using them appropriately and responsibly.

"788","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have a connective tissue disorder, called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. It's a cousin disorder to something more common that you may have heard of, Marfan's Syndrome. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome however, is rarely diagnosed correctly, and still is categorized as a rare illness. The gist of this syndrome, is that my body cannot produce enough collagen.Collagen makes up a large portion of your body, including skin, hair, organ linings, arteries and veins, and the cushioning between joints. That means, my skin is very fragile and bruises easily. I am at higher chance for organ perforation and rupture, as well as prolapses. It also puts me at risk of death from spontaneous aneurysm. The most painful of all, is that it makes my joints extremely hypermobile, meaning my joints dislocate very easily. Easily enough, that I wake up from sleeping with dislocations, that I have to reduce myself before I can even get out of bed.

Ehlers Danlos isn't the only painful disease I have, I also have: Chiari Malformation, Endometriosis, Craniocervical Instability, Dysautonomia, and Mast Cell Activation disorder. Which cause anything from migraines, heavy painful periods, and tachycardia, to severe gnawing bone pain and random anaphylaxis. Several of my diseases have been described by experts, to be just as bad as cancer pain, and they also put me at a higher risk for developing things like cancer, MS, and parkinson's. I didn't ask for any of these diseases. They are things that I was genetically born with. I didn't ask to be in excruciating pain every minute of every day. So why are you trying to punish me and people like me? 

The current climate in this country surrounding opioids and pain management in general is atrocious. 

To fix an addiction problem, which ultimately stems from mental illness; the solution provided by the current administration and PROP is to take pain management away from everyone? Including chronically ill and disabled individuals? It doesn't make sense to me, and in fact, I see it causing an even bigger issue. Every day, I'm hearing of multiple suicides committed by chronic pain patients, because they have been grossly neglected by the medical system to the point where they cannot take the pain anymore. Not to mention, not treating pain is not an option. It just isn't. Not treating pain can cause spontaneous death, heart attack, stroke, and other life threatening events. A pain patient receiving opioid medication, is no different than a diabetic receiving insulin. The only difference is diabetic medications don't have street value. Just because a pain patient's medications do, doesn't mean they should be denied medical treatment. Especially when the addiction rate among chronic pain patients is under 4%.

People need these medications to function. Have you ever had the flu? No I'm not talking about a cold, but the flu. Body aches,dislocations, bone pain, fevers, severe stomach cramps, organs twisting and eating themselves, extreme exhaustion, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, etc etc. and it stuck around for days on end? Well now imagine it never going away. Imagine having to stand up, imagine having to function, take care of your house, go to work, prepare food, care for your children? People cannot function in that amount of pain, day after day; and frankly to insinuate that someone should have to, is grossly inhumane. Frankly, if this deliberate behavior by PROP and other elected officials continues, in some cases it could be looked at like a eugenics movement to erradicate disabled individuals.

To fix this problem, knowledgable doctors and actual chronic pain patients NEED to be included in this discussion on how to fix the 'Opioid Crisis', as it is affecting us more than anyone else. Taking medication away from us won't keep illicit drugs off the street if they are coming over the borders. Andrew Kolodny, who is a part of the opioid commision, is historically anti-opioid, and has manipulated numbers in order to push his own agenda. An agenda that created the 2016 opioid guidelines, which have been widely misinterpreted to be mandates, rather than guidelines; and in turn is causing medical neglect, suicides and sudden deaths of thousands of american citizens.

Please stop and consider that there are real people who are being affected by these laws. People who didn't ask to be disabled or in intractable pain all the time. You cannot take EVERY form of pain management away from them, or you will have another epidemic on your hands. Every day people are taking their lives because of doctors neglecting their duties because of the pressure that the government is putting on them. Not treating pain is NOT an option. Unless you want another epidemic on your hands; one that these laws will have started and will be responsible for. Please include chronic pain patients in this discussion and STOP deleting their comments because they don't fit your agenda; as that is ILLEGAL.

This severely impacts quality of life and can produce significant health problems stemming from untreated pain. Suicides by chronic pain patients based on a reduction in MME is a growing problem that is not being addressed. I can provide a list of chronic pain patients that have committed suicide following large reductions in their MME if requested. The CDC guidelines should not be treated as hard limits and should not override chronic pain patients' doctors' assessments of adequate MME to control pain. 

There is little evidence that chronic pain patients account for a significant part of the US epidemic of opioid overdoses. Research shows that few chronic pain patients become addicted to opioids prescribed to treat their conditions. Those that do show abuse often have other substance abuse issues prior to initial prescription to treat chronic pain. (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1507771) Any concern that chronic pain patients might abuse opioids through ""doctor shopping"" and other indicators of possible substance abuse can be better mitigated through required use of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs than reduction in daily MME. The accidental overdose risks associated with MME >100 especially through use of long acting opioids are largely found in the first two weeks patients are on a higher MME. Thus hard limit of 90MME for chronic pain patients who have been on MME >100 for more than a few weeks will do little to reduce accidental overdoses compared to the certainty of a reduced quality of life from untreated pain.

"795","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am writing to express my extreme opposition to Medicare's proposed plan to limit all opioid prescriptions above 90 MME (Morphine Milligram Equivalent).   I have suffered with chronic intractable pain, as a result of surgical complications, for more than 2 decades.  My diagnoses include chronic abdominal pain, chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), occipital neuralgia, and migraines.   Like many who suffer with chronic intractable pain, my doctor and I exhausted all available treatment modalities before initiating long-term opioid therapy.  I've tried and failed anti-inflammatory medications, NSAIDS, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, physical therapy, acupuncture, localized injections, nerve blocks, tens unit, spinal stimulator, occipital neurostimulator and naturopathic medications.  

Opioids don't eliminate my pain and something as simple as vacuuming my bedroom or a short walk can cause my pain to flare.  Like most people who suffer with incurable chronic pain, I experience high a level of pain 24/7.  Opioid analgesics provide a temporary lessening of my pain, allowing me periods of respite from my daily suffering, improve my ability to function, and enable me to participate in the daily activities of my life.  Without these necessary medications, I would be housebound, bed-bound, and my life would be one of constant agony. 

This proposal seeks to align Medicare/Medicaid rules with the 2016 CDC Guidelines.  These Guidelines were shown to be grounded upon weak medical evidence, cherry picking of research, conflation of data, unclear methodology, and faulty statistics.  It's also important to note that there was an inherent conflict of interest and anti-opioid bias by those who developed these guidelines.  We cannot continue to allow the opinions of the CDC to be the basis for any new medical policies.   

It's important to point out that addiction is uncommon among people who take opioids for chronic pain.  In fact, opioid misuse is less than 3% in this population.  Additionally, the vast majority of pain management centers employ policies and procedures including random urine screens, pain contracts, utilization of a single pharmacy for all prescription medications, and scrutiny through the State's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) to further discourage any nefarious behavior.  

Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) dosing was designed in an attempt to examine opioids with similar analgesic effects and not to determine an exact mathematical dosing conversion.   Such arbitrary limits do not take into account genetic factors that create a great deal of variability in opioid metabolism and tolerance among patients.  Medicine is not a one-size fits all  what works for one patient may not work for another.  In no other area of medicine are such arbitrary limits utilized, and we should not allow such a practice to affect the practice of pain management.  In fact, since the CDC Guidelines were published, long-term pain patients who had been stable and well managed on opioid analgesics for years have been unfairly targeted and denied appropriate medical care.  Their life-saving pain medications were abruptly tapered or discontinued all together, leading to increased suffering, loss of function, disability, and even suicide by those unable to bear their agony.  I, myself, faced a 50% reduction of my opioid medications which has caused my pain to increase and my functioning to decrease.  If this petition is approved, chronic pain patients could face further reductions of our opioid medications, rendering them useless and relegating us to lives of unimaginable, unrelenting pain and suffering.  Many of us would end up housebound, bed bound, lose any remaining independence, and those who cannot bear the pain may choose suicide.

In conclusion, I strongly object to the proposal to implement a hard limit of 90 MME for all opioid medications.  Since the majority of opioid deaths now result from people consuming illicit drugs, steps to limit the prescribing of opioid medications for chronic pain run the risk of harming pain patients while having little effect on stopping addiction.  Additionally, because there is no accurate, validated, or universally accepted way to calculate total MEDD (Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose), it should invalidate its use as a tool in clinical policy decisions and in the development of prescribing guidelines.  We must not continue to allow groups who have no relevant medical training or experience in the field of pain management, make medical policies and decisions for those suffering with pain.  Our medical care and treatment needs to be left in the hands of our doctors.

I had bad reactions from ""alternate"" prescriptions which landed me in an emergency room via an ambulance trip with even more medical bills to pay. This policy will further encumber physicians from adequately treating patients, and more decision-making powers should not be granted to insurance companies. Later, when I did get insurance, my doctors and I had to go through additional steps for approvals from the insurance company, even though my deductible was so high that I ended up not being able to afford them out-of-pocket anyway.  I did not want to have use opioids in the first place, but they are needed to enable those suffering with chronic pain to have any quality of life. I will add, also, that I have no criminal record, pay taxes, vote, and worked all of my life until illness forced me to stop working. The majority of chronic pain sufferers use their medications as prescribed and are model patients. It makes no sense to take away one's rights to appropriate treatment as deemed by a physician and not by an insurance company or a governmental agency responding to a hyper-inflated ""crisis.""","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0797","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","Sherri Underwood-IN"

"802","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"An Open Letter to My Senator: CDC Has Killed Me

Dear Senator Harris,

The CDC has killed me!

Let me repeat that: The CDC has killed me!

I have a severe neurological condition - RSD/CRPS - that causes me unspeakable and crippling pain. Opioid pain medication is literally the only thing keeping me alive. But with the issuance of the CDC's short sighted, so-called voluntary opioid prescribing guidelines -- which are being rammed down the throats of medical providers -- my pain management doctor has cut me off of opiates.

For the last 10 years, I have been subjected to nearly every type of physical therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, medical treatment and medication applicable to my affliction. The one and only thing that has ever had any demonstrable benefit in even temporarily suppressing my pain to a tolerable level has, unfortunately, been opiates.

In early October, I was told that I would have to stop taking either the oral opiates or the intrathecal opiates, as it was now illegal for a person to receive two different types of opiates via two different delivery methods concurrently - this is patently false but this is what my doctor told me. This was a major problem, as even with both the oral and intrathecal opiates, my pain was severely under-managed to the point where I was almost completely bedridden. I left the house only to go to doctor's appointments.

When I was told that my pain management regimen - specifically the opiates - was going to be cut in half, even though my pain was already grossly under-managed, I spoke out about this.

As a result, not only was I cut off from the oral opiates, I got kicked out of the pain management practice where I have been a patient for more than seven years. The doctor said he didn't want to risk his license - but was perfectly willing to risk my life - over the CDC opioid guidelines. These guidelines are supposed to be voluntary and are not supposed to take desperately needed pain medication away from legitimate chronic pain sufferers such as myself.

I expect that within 60 days, I will be dead from either heart failure or a stroke due to my body's inability to cope with the stress of the unrelenting pain. My neuropsychologist, who has been treating me for nearly 10 years, has consistently rated my level of pain as moderate to extreme, even while being medicated with both oral and intrathecal opiates, which I am now denied.

I'm not dead yet, but within 60 days I expect that the CDC will have effectively killed me. I honestly don't see myself being able to tolerate the pain any longer than that. What I do see is the extreme likelihood of death by heart attack, stroke or circulatory seizure due to intolerable pain and the unendurable stress it places on the human body.

Congress, in going along with this blindly, will be explicitly complicit in this negligent homicide - or homicide by depraved indifference, take your pick - of one human being needlessly suffering indescribable pain - that being myself.

I would like to thank you, Senator, and all the rest of your colleagues for murdering me.

To help ease your conscience, it is not just me that Congress is complicit in murdering, but thousands, possibly tens of thousands of people in like positions.

Sincerely,

"805","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"To Whom It May Concern,
The Pain Committee of Kaweah Delta Health Care District (KDCHD) has concerns about the impact of the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' proposed rule changes for 2019 under the Medicare Advantage and Part D Act.  KDHCD is a 581 bed community teaching hospital located in Visalia, CA. It serves nearly 600,000 people in the Central Valley of California. Approximately 55% of the population  receives Medi-Cal benefits.  The population to primary care provider ratio is 2,350:1, almost twice the state average.   The Pain Committee is an interdisciplinary group of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses overseeing the inpatient and outpatient pain management policies of the Health Care District. The proposed changes will have a detrimental effect on the management of not only our patients but acute and chronic pain patients everywhere.  Specifically the Committee would like to bring the following to your attention: 
Page 210, paragraph 2: a one-time 7 day allowance to patients who meet the 90 Morphine milligram equivalents (MME) increases the burden to the patient and the prescriber.  In our area the number of pain management physicians is limited.  This change will be an undue burden for the prescriber who must reauthorize the prescription and justify the edit.  The fear is the added requirement will further limit access for patients to pain management providers and result in overutilization of the Emergency Department.  There should be a process to over-ride this one-time  fill if the situation arises.  For example, if a patient needs to be rotated to a different opioid agent what are the options to prevent lapses in therapy from a time delay in filling the new prescription?   
Additionally, there must be a logical process to continue opioids after 7 days, if needed.  Most patients will not require more than a 7 day supply of opioids for their acute pain but there are exceptions.  A process should be in place to help minimize the inconvenience to the patient and prescriber when offering appropriate treatment for complex medical problems causing subacute and chronic pain.  In our community, physician availability for many patients is limited.  Many patients may be unable to locate or make an appointment with a primary care provider within 7 days.  A process that authorizes prescriptions beyond this time for appropriate medical conditions should be in place, especially in medically underserved areas.    
Finally, there is concern that the proposed 2019 changes will increase the number of handwritten opioid prescriptions and increase the need for office visits to obtain such prescriptions.  This unduly burdens the health care provider and patients.  We appreciate the efforts to minimize the harm opioids cause and agree that rational restrictions on prescribing are in order.  However, avenues that allow for exceptions to the limitations placed on opioid prescribing should be available for prescribers dealing with complex medical problems and stable chronic pain patients especially in medically underserved areas.  
Respectfully submitted,

"806","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Dear CMS, 

While I understand your agency is working hard to mitigate the risks that have come to be believed to be ubiquitously associated with the prescribing of (""high dose""), opioid medications such as respiratory duress, addiction, and diversion I am hoping that you will consider all of the chronic intractable pain patients who absolutely benefit from doses higher than the (unsubstantiated risk limit of 20,50,90 or 100MME), current ""recommended"" dose limit.  Furthermore, I hope you will understand that the vast majority of patients are not diverting their medications!  Patients need their medications to have a quality of life and no amount of money could ever replace that fact.  All you need to do is a Google search to see that the vast majority of diverted pills are either counterfeit or diverted by pharmacies, last mile heists, manufacturing plants, nursing homes, drug cartel, and so forth.  Moreover, it is not the American way to punish everyone for what a sub group does, to take away a person's right to keep the law, or to assume everyone is capable of committing a crime.  Patients are not soulless people that would trade risking the harm or death of another human just because they have the means!  I personally find it appalling that our government is alright with judging every individual by the actions of someone else.  Utilitarianism is not supposed to be a core aspect of a Constitutional Democratic Republic!  And yet, here we are putting innocent people in harms way, forcing them out of their jobs, college, and into bed unable to cook, clean, ""love"", shower, let alone exercise or to participate in supplemental pain management programs such as counseling, physical therapy, and so forth.  Where has our American spirit gone?  Where has 'One Nation Under God' gone?  Do you believe god would want to see sick, disabled, and hurting people pushed aside without a voice or made to writhe when he provided a safe and effective means to abate the suffering and pain of his children!?  The pain community should not suffer because of mistakes some doctors made or because some unscrupulous doctors took advantage of the zeitgeist regarding the initiative to better treat pain! 

I pray to god that you will take into consideration the actual facts regarding the use of opioid medications such as they are still the safest and best medicine for a good percent of intractable pain patients.  The risk of addiction among people in the general pop. has been determined to be roughly 5%, it's less than 1% among intractable pain patients, and that the rate of addiction has not increased since 1910.  

Historically, when most physicians have prescribed narcotic medications they failed to properly educate their patients about keeping their meds safe, the effects of opioids, risks associated with long term opioid therapy, risks of sharing their prescription, and they failed to discuss an exit strategy for patients who had an acute need for narcotic pain relief or for patients who may have required narcotics for a few months.  I believe this failure caused many patients to develop a fear of cessation. Therefore, I truly believe moving forward that any new patients should attend an educational program at the onset of therapy.  I believe this could help patients to understand things such as experiencing a euphoric feeling from their first dose and how the feeling should or will subside, that it is unlikely to return even if they take more than prescribed and that doing so would ONLY put them at risk for respiratory duress or possibly failure. 

Tylenol results in tens of thousands of emergency room visits every year due to toxicity and overdose.  Tylenol and NSAIDs cause more physical damage than opioid medications. Tylenol and Ibuprofen are by far more dangerous albeit they don't (usually), cause aberrant behavior which is something we would all like to see eradicated or abated at the least.  But, let's be honest, people who are prone to aberrant behavior are going to do so rather they can buy prescription pills, cocaine, heroin, illicit Fentanyl or whatever their choice of self destruction tends to be.  

On behalf of the entire chronic pain community I beg you, at the least, to postpone this initiative not to cover doses above the CDC recommendation until the pain community has a voice and until doctors that do not agree with this initiative have been heard.  I ask that you consider, at the least, applying this initiative to ONLY newly diagnosed patients with chronic pain and for ONLY an interim period where they'd be required to try all other means of pain management before coverage of more than 90MME, to consider not all pain medications can be converted to morphine, to consider tolerance of patients who had been stable on higher doses, to cover the cost for patients who've already tried other medications and therapies, and to set up a patient education program. 

Thank you for your consideration. ","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0903","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Morris Murphy-ME"

You are changing the way pain is thought of and treated in this country. Physicians will see this as government interference and choose to not prescribe pain medications at all, regardless of their patients needs. Medical students will absorb this false max dose as a limit to never be exceeded, without having any real understanding of the many reasons some patients require these higher doses.

Government should only be allowed to interefere in this process if it can be shown that harm could reasonably come to the patient from employing the chosen course of therapy. If a patient has been taking medication at a given level for many years with no problem, there is really no case to be made for government interference.  The opioidcrisis which law enfor ement and the medical profession are trying to address has nothing to do with this case. In fact, if the data is properly interpreted, longstamding cases involving chronic pain being treated with doses of opiate medication far in excess of proposed regulatory limits have no relation whatsoever to the overdose problem, or even the addiction issue. Addiction and dependence are two different entities. Many people become dependent on medications for everything from diabetes to depression which they are not free to  quit without undergoing a tapering off program to avoid dangerous complications.

My doctor tried to give me just 10 mg of Oxsee cotton and my insurance company refused to fill it because they wanted him to give me something stronger to make sure my pain was being taken care of!  I've gone from 100 mg of oxycodone daily with a 50 g Fenton all patch every 72 hours to 60 mg of oxycodone a day!  When my neurologist took a look at my MRIs he actually thought I was in a severe accident and when he found out I wasn't he felt so bad for me!  He told me I was too young to have this many problems with my back and there was no surgery that could help me in this I already knew because I have researched everything!  I was granted access to laser spine Institute and my insurance was going to cover it but the pain doctor that I see pulled the control card! He told me if I went and had the surgery done and I was still in pain he would not be able to see me anymore as a doctor!  I would have to fly to Florida and have it done there and stay for five days to be monitored and then come back home and he refused to see me after that!  One other thing that this pain doctor could do is put in that I have a 25% cross tolerance and he'd be able to increase my pain medicine by doing that but he refused.  Chronic pain patients are not the problem here! We are the ones that are following the guidelines prior to being stripped of our dosing! I have never been overmedicated buy any doctor that I have seen for this and I stay with the same doctor and the same pharmacy  but yet no matter how honest I am I have to deal with the outcome of these crappy laws that hurt me  but no one cares! They don't need to care because they can get their drugs like I said at anytime! They can make all the laws and restrictions and it doesn't make them lose sleep because if they need pain medicine they'll get it! And NO, you don't  take an aspirin and deal with the pain!  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the pharmaceutical companies are going to start selling to the patients themselves because they are losing billions of dollars due to this law !  I am betting you sooner than later they're going to find a way to do that!  There's a loophole to everything isn't there?

"822","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a 71 year old retired woman and the primary care giver of a 38 year old son born with Spina Bifida of the lumbar region/myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus, who now has a tethered cord, bladder cystotomy with suprapubic drainage, neuropathy, arthritis, insomnia, anxiety and depression.  My son's primary insurance is Medicare, his AARP MedicareRX saver coverage is paid from his SSD and I pay for additional secondary coverage through UnitedHealth Care under my federal health care coverage as he is a qualified dependent with a qualifying disability. 

Since birth I have had to work/challenge/advocate/educate/beg and plea with the health care/educational/Social Security systems/etc. in order to provide as much as possible a quality of life for my son. At this point he spends more than 75% of his life in bed coping with the constant pain from doing basic activities of daily living. He is desperately trying to retain some semblance of independence even at the price of pain. After many years of dealing with increasing pain, inflammation and infections and multiple medications and changes he has been on fentanyl patches for over 4 years for an equivalent amount of 150 in patches of 100 and 50 every 3 days. He is also on oxycodone hcl 15 mg, 120 for 30 days; baclofen 10 mg, 180 for 30 days; paroxetine hcl 10 mg 30 for 30 days. He is meticulous in using his medication as indicated and does not engage in actions that could jeopardize his life and safety.
 
He and his primary doctor work hard to try to balance his medical condition and chronic pain with quality of life concerns as well as health/welfare and safety issues. It is not easy and a constant challenge especially given todays climate in the healthcare industry. However, this seems to be the combination that works for him at this time. But we have a constant worry that his physician will decide that the never ending back and forth in paperwork with the insurance carriers and pharmacy and the health care regulators/physician oversight entities, will lead her to drop him as a patient and he will have no one to take on his care. 

Right now we are in the midst of appealing to UnitedHealth Care the reduction to the 90 mg of morphine equivalents because it is being done without concern for him as an individual but rather as a knee jerk reaction to whatever the current ""hot potato"" issue is.

I am appalled and enraged that because our nation has not been able to address the issues relating to addiction, chronic pain, and undiagnosed health and mental health conditions, the most vulnerable segments of populations are to bear the greatest burden. I am terrified that should I die or become disabled before he dies he will have no one to help him with his needs and be in constant pain. Tell me that that time energy and resources are being used to address the source of pain and disability in a meaningful and compassionate manner and I would support that in any way I could. But don't tell me that capriciously taking away the only lifeline that my son has to live without pain because being on some kinds of pain medication is ""bad for you"" is the answer. History has shown that research studies are not always the end all and that science at times does not know what it does not know.

"823","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"On behalf of and all those Medicare beneficiaries who have major medical problems that require ongoing pain management, please do not enact changes for opioid prescribing that could negatively impact their quality of life and ongoing health issues. Undertreated pain in the disabled and elderly populations can affect not only their ability to perform activities of daily living, but can pose grave dangers to their health, including death, from side effects of untreated pain such as increased blood pressure, heart rate and increased cardiac strain.  The potential efficacy of opioid medications in chronic pain management is well established. From Cochrane reviews to policy statements from the Mayo Clinic, there is medical value here. The under-treatment of pain among the elderly is already a problem, and the opioid crisis is impacting cancer pain care and hospice care, too.  Opioid medications are best left as a last option for treatment, after all other methods fail, but are still a very important and timely last option. 
         We strongly object to the government's continued interference in the medical care of intractable pain patients. We believe that patients and their doctors should be making the decisions about their healthcare, not the federal government partnered with insurance companies.
         We strongly oppose the Centers for Medicare adopting the March 2016 Centers for Disease Control Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The proposal that ""all sponsors implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90MME- the dose ceiling recommended by the CDC. This will give pharmacies and insurance carriers the right to over-ride the physicians prescription which is based on the physician's knowledge of individual conditions and medical necessity, not an arbitrary number of MME's, and will result in the pharmacy refusing to fill prescriptions. Not only is this number of MME's arbitrary and unscientific, it excludes those outlier's, who by no fault of their own, have different rates of metabolism of many types of medications. It will cause unneeded suffering and increased pain in a population already struggling with on-going and intractable health conditions.

I was lucky to survive. I am a full time college student and work two jobs while going into radiology in college. I have a beautiful 2 year old boy who loves to run and play with his mother. Unfortunately, the past two years my chronic pain issues became overbearing. Normally I could control most of my pain with yoga, massage, physical therapy and exercise. But with my additional diagnoses of Interstatial cystitis and endometriosis, the pain became too much to bear. At first, no one knew what was wrong with me, I spent many, many hours in the emergency department and in the hospital. Many doctors were cruel to me and sent me away with nothing more then dirty looks. Finally a urologist figured out the blood in my urine, bladder tissue in my urine samples and repeat urinary tract infections were not normal. It took almost 3 months of agony, laying on my couch in tears, missing weeks of work, school and being a mother before a doctor was willing to treat me. I had a few procedures done and was referred to pelvic floor therapy and a pain management clinic. The pain management made it possible for me to push through PT, which has allowed me to return to work and online classes this semester. Without the proper amount of pain medication I am back to my couch.  I live in constant fear of that all consuming, life destroying pain that made me feel suicide was the only answer to escape the horrid constant pain. I am so grateful for having my life back, I pray that us in chronic pain will not be punished for those who abuse medication. All I want is to be able to play with my son, wear a cap and gown at graduation, work in the medical field to help others and be able to get out of bed without crying every day. Do not place these new restrictions, it is already hard enough to receive proper care as it is now. I was very close to ending my life due to those challenges. Drug addicts will still find ways to get their ""fix"" and the chronic pain patients will begin dying off. I've lost a few chronic pain friends this year already. Please help us, not punish us.

Because of the new CDC guidelines that have already been changed,  l lost two thirds of the pain medication that allowed me to have a life worth living.  In the past 10 months I have been forced to forge ahead with the small amount of medication I am now ""allowed"" to have...this change has caused a serious decline in my health as I have been forced to deal with higher pain levels. I have higher blood pressure (not good with a serious rare kidney disease that is rapidly progressing to end stage) & now I have heart issues & chest pain that I didn't have when I was being treated with the correct dosages of pain medication. I enjoy a very trusting relationship with my doctor, who has been my prescribing physician for more than 10 years. That means 10 years of intense monitoring, including monthly visits, regular & random drug testing & written contracts. I have always adhered to my prescribed treatment, but pressure being placed upon a compassionate doctor by threatening them with extreme oversight & the possibility of losing everything they have worked so hard to achieve is not only unfair...it's criminal, in my opinion. The government needs to stop punishing the chronically ill & disabled because there are people who abuse the very medications that allow me & others like me to actually live a productive life! There is no actual science that says placing limitations on these life saving pain medications will do anything to stem the tide of illegal drugs (especially illicit fentanyl laced heroin) from flowing into the US & then into the hands of drug addicts.

This is ultimately a drastic limitation on the basic promise of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" for a wide range of Americans. We as people with chronic pain often need these medications to be able to work, to function as parents and caregivers and citizens. Sometimes we cannot work but the medications allow us a better quality of life. In the first attempt at limiting opioid prescriptions in the VA, the VA noted in a study that the only indicator that *increased* was the number of suicides.

"840","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am the parent of a daughter who has suffered with chronic pain, as the result of surgical complications, for more than two decades.  I have watched my daughter's daily struggle with debilitating, unrelenting pain.  She has always been a responsible and proactive participant in her medical care. 

I strongly object to the petitioners' efforts to interfere in the medical care of chronic pain patients like my daughter.  Their misguided efforts, and singular view that treating pain is the primary reason for the ""Opioid Crisis,"" mischaracterizes the problem.  Worse, it conflates the need of people in pain with the efforts to curb illegal drug use, leaving those suffering with chronic pain few treatment options.   

I still hope that there will be medical advancements/breakthroughs in the near future that will alleviate my daughter's pain and suffering.  Until then, it is important that we not lose sight of the fact that, like my daughter, there is a segment of the chronic pain population for whom all available treatment modalities have been exhausted, and for whom there are no other alternatives except opioid medication.

We must not allow policies to be implemented that will create barriers to appropriate medical care and restrict access to needed opioid medications.  We must not continue to allow groups, who have no relevant medical training or experience in the field of pain management, make medical policies and decisions for those suffering with pain.  Their efforts would be better spent in supporting and investing in medical research that has the potential to develop new medications and treatments to treat and potentially prevent chronic pain, rather than continuing to try to implement policies that will further unfairly penalize, discriminate against and stigmatize an already marginalized population.

I am a Medicare/Medicaid patient or future patient - or have a private insurer which often follows Medicare policies.
I am a pain patient diagnosed with (spinal stenosis herniated discs osteoarthritis ) for (14) years. I tried( all other so called pain med ) - list all the non-opioids (n-saids,SSRIs, SNRIs, Steroids, anti-epileptics, BEFORE opioids  (i.e., PT, OT, Aqua T, Chiro, Osteo, injections, devices, procedures, CBT/mindfulness, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, TENs, MENS, natural remedies, etc.) but they all failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and (suffering to where I am able to be a functioning supportive member of society able to work be active more with family no depression from the damn pain.._) - improved function that opioids help with working, chores, childcare, travel, entertainment, etc.
If Medicare/Medicaid/private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME/any dosage I will lose your job, income, home, car, entertainment, not be able to care for family/house, etc.
I have been a model, compliant patient,  have a pain contract - random UAs, pill counts, every month and dr visits before anything is written.
My medications are stored safely and secured as directed by the dr and i use one pharmacy, avoid alcohol, cannabis, etc. it is unlikely my condition will improve and the effects of time and aging will make things worse. Opioids and pain management were a last resort options unfortunately 
Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.
These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.
Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.
I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain.
My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.
A 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.
A 7-day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.
I take Benzos,for anxiety and Gabapentin, Lyrica) safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed.  Explain what might happen if these were to be discontinued.
FYI
Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

CMS is totally forgetting that those with disabling medical conditions, who are more likely to have severe pain, will also be impacted. This is a draconian solution applied to everyone, regardless of whether they are abusing opiates or not.

Ongoing narcotic prescriptions already receive a soft flag (e.g., questions raised to both the pharmacists and doctors). By CMS's own account, their current system is working well.

Arbitrarily limiting narcotics to 7 days represent a serious hurdle to appropriate care at a time when people may need it most. Requiring an in-person appointment every 7 days is unreasonable - by definition, those are narcotics should not be driving so getting to those appointments becomes extremely problematic, especially for those in rural areas. For acute patients, they should be spending their energy recovering, not going to unnecessary doctors appointments. For chronic pain patients whose condition is stable, weekly appointments are unnecessarily time-consuming and may impact their ability to hold a job. Such frequent appointments will add yet another task for caregivers of seriously ill patients. Furthermore, this assumes the physicians will have time in their appointment schedule every week for any and all severe pain patients, something that is highly unlikely. This is unnecessarily burdensome to patients, caregivers, and doctors alike.

Allowing only the insurers the right to override that limit is begging for industry abuse - they have every incentive to deny an override and no incentive to agree. Desk workers at insurance companies (who may have very limited information regarding patients' overall medical conditions and who are not treating physicians) should NOT be responsible for determining care! They are not trained for it and they have no way to judge which patients are using medications appropriately and which ones are not since they have no face-to-face interactions with patients.

This proposed regulation treat everyone as an addict, including people recovering from serious car accidents or surgery, people with terminal cancer, and people with other significant, well-documented chronic pain issues where appropriate narcotic use allows a return to normal life. Not everyone who uses narcotics does so inappropriately and not all are addicts. There is copious evidence that appropriate narcotic use can significantly improve the quality of life for those with severe pain and that the vast majority of those appropriately prescribed narcotics do not become addicted.

Preventing appropriate and regulated medical access for those with a true need will unnecessarily disable those with severe pain which could be treated. Furthermore, it will drive some to the street to get medication (with all its attendant dangers) and others to suicide. This overly broad regulation will destroy many more lives than it helps.

"860","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a pain patient diagnosed with widespread osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, migraines and fibromyalgia. I've tried managing my symptoms with medications like Lyrica, Gabapentin, Soma, flexeril, various NSAIDs (I do use Mobic now but many NSAIDs gave me intolerable side effects), amitryptiline, trazodone, celexa, lexapro, Cymbalta (which gave me stroke-like side-effects), topamax. I do take Prozac for migraine management. I've had physical therapy, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, TENs, supplements, and massage. Some treatments made me worse, some had intolerable side effects, some helped but not for very long. Some caused depression or increased fatigue and suicidal ideation. 

I use trigger point injections, over-the-counter creams, self-care at home (Epsom salts/soaking, heating pads and massage tools), stress management techniques like mindfulness meditation, even green tea which is a natural muscle relaxant. I'm very motivated to help myself. 

Opiods are the most helpful treatment I have, and they allow me to work full-time. Without access to opiods, I can't get restful sleep at night and the pain just dogs me all day long. Truly, every day is a struggle, but opiods give me a quality of life that makes my life meaningful and purposeful. People with addiction problems have a decline in the quality of life related to opiod use but many chronic pain patients have measurable and meaningful improvements in their quality of life as a result of responsible medication use. I do not crave my medication - in fact, I often skip doses and I never take more than prescribed. I know that opiods will not eliminate my pain. I do not know what the future brings for me, but I feel I have to fight NOW because I see what it's bringing for my mother: 

My mother also has widespread osteoarthritis and has had two surgeries on her back as well as total knee replacement, hand surgeries and breast reduction surgery all to try to treat her painful ailments or to take weight off her back. Her last back surgery was a failed back surgery - she has screws that broke inside her back. Her case is so complex that the local doctor won't touch it. 

Pain policies are being dictated by politicians, not physicians. They are harming chronic pain patients and reducing our access to necessary and helpful treatments. Alternatives are either ineffective, unaffordable/not covered by insurance or limited in rural areas like where my parents live. 

I've been seeing patients like me who have committed suicide. I'm 39 years old. My mother is 64 years old and on Medicare Social Security Disability. If I'm ever unable to work due to my health, I may also be on disability someday. I pray not. I value my work and nearly committed suicide because of inadequate treatment of my pain and fatigue. Work helps give my life meaning but chronic pain is a thief. 

Policies are being made without thought to patients' needs. They are causing doctors to change their treatment plans out of fear rather than what they feel is best for their patients. My mother and I, and other chronic pain patients should not be persecuted by lawmakers. Most chronic pain patients do NOT abuse their medications, and do not divert their medications. 

Please, allow doctors to do their jobs. Do not limit patients to a 7-day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME -- it takes longer than that for paperwork to even be completed. Allow doctors to actually doctor patients. Recognize that patients have different needs. I understand that the calculations that the 90MME is based on is arbitrary and hard for doctors to apply. 

Do not destroy lives. Do not be the cause of patient suicides. Recognize that you are not a doctor, and that guidelines should not be arbitrary as these are.

"862","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"THERE IS NO PRESCRIPTION OPIOID CRISIS! What is there not to understand about this? The crisis is how the government is choking off the medical establishment from prescribing the ""best option"" out there for chronic pain; pain that can't be treated any other way. This fabricated ""Opioid Crisis"" has nothing to do with properly treating 106 MILLION PEOPLE in the US whose lives have been severely altered by PAIN (physically, emotionally and psychologically) which doctors know they can treat well with Opioids. What the government and now the medical establishment (forced on by the government) has done to chronic pain patients is an utter travesty!

BE AWARE, there are 2 distinct points of discussion surrounding Opioids with completely different origins & completely different prevention and treatment modalities. DO NOT confuse the TWO! There are PRESCRIPTION opioids used for acute & chronic pain & ILLEGAL opioids used to get high (used by addicts for another type of pain; undiagnosed and untreated psychological and/or physical pain). For this, mental health care, drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies in addition to adequate pain control/treatment comes into play. However, you can see these are all woefully lacking in America and it's getting WORSE! Arbitrary limits on opioids will not solve this never-ending, social dilemma. 

Like so many of us with chronic pain there are no alternatives and opioids are the best option. Their efficacy has been proven, lives have been improved (even saved). People are able to work, play, travel, love and LIVE! People in CHRONIC PAIN-33% of Americans, are forced to live in hourly, daily pain DENIED by the CDC, the Government, the DEA and Doctors (made fearful to prescribe medicine that works well for us-yes Opioids) the ability to live one hour without unrelenting pain. There is medicine ready available for us which works when NOTHING ELSE will-Opioids. You wouldn't stop giving heart medication to a cardiac patient, insulin to a diabetic or chemotherapy to a cancer patient, so WHY. DO. YOU. STOP. TREATING. PAIN. EFFECTIVELY?! 

To our Medical Society, take care of the sick, the infirmed and the suffering as you were TRAINED. Take a stand and do not allow uneducated dictators and regulators in our government to rule your role as a Physician when you know what's right. There's nothing natural or normal about having severe, unrelenting pain. Don't be fearful, as you must advocate for the sick. Please fight for what's right or this may very well be you or a loved one very soon!!

I have a private insurer which often follows Medicare policies. I am a pain patient diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis for 2 years, although I have dealt with chronic pain symptoms for 10 years.  I have tried several medications including steroids, nsaids, tricyclic anti-depressants, SSRIs and SNRIs before trying opiods.  In addition, I regularly attend physical therapy, I regularly see a PhD psychologist for mindfulness treatment, I attend aqua fitness classes (2x a week) and pilates (2x a week) and yoga once a week as recommended by my physican and physical therapist.  I have visited a chiropractor (although I no longer do, as my spine is starting to fuse, so it is no longer recommended).  I regularly get massage therapy.  

Opioids help me by managing my pain and allowing me to continue functioning.  Without pain management, during flares I am unable to even roll over in bed.  I can't walk, complete basic personal hygiene tasks, take care of my two toddlers or work.  During these flares, opiods help me continue to function.  Allowing me to work, take care of myself and take care of my chidlren.  

If my private insurer (who often follows medicaid policy) refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME/any dosage I may lose your job, income, home and car. I will not be able to care for family/house, etc.  I will need someone to help care for me.  

I have been a model, compliant patient.  I use the minimum effective dose of medication only when needed.  I avoid alcohol, I participate in all recommended non-medication based therapies.  I use only one pharmacy and make sure that all my medications are prescribed by physicians in the same healthcare system so that they all have access to my records and other prescription innformation.  Ankylosing Spondylitis in a non-curable degenerative disease.  My condition will NOT improve and over time is likely to get worse.  Opioids and pain management are a last resort option that I currently use as infrequently as possible.

Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.  These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.  The policies may force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, increase the risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.

My medical care and decision making should be left to my team of highly capable doctors, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.  Limiting my options to a 7 day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at my pharmacy, increase the need for me to travel while in extreme pain beccause I would need multiple pharmacy trips while in pain.

A 7 day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship.  It doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors.
15. I take my medications safely - I do not mix them with alcohol, other substances and use as directed.

Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.  I do not agree with the 90 MME.

I have 7 herniated discs, 2 of which are dessicated and compressing the nerve root. My scoliosis & herniations in my neck are compressing my thecal sac causing neurological disorders and migraines. 

I was able to work full time while taking opioids for 15 years but after being assaulted my condition worsened and I have been unable to work since 2013. I am currently a Medicaid patient who has been discriminated against and unable to obtain my pain medication due to my doctors fear of losing his license. He suggested I go to another pain mgmt doctor but I cannot find one to accept Medicaid now. 

I rely upon opioid medications to have a fairly decent quality of life with my children and to be able to care for them, attend their school functions and after school activities and most importantly to be able to prepare a healthy meal that isn't frozen and microwaved.

Opioid medications provide me a way of life and give me hope for functioning outside of my house in the future. 

Opioid medication has managed my incurable intractable debilitating pain and

These proposed regulations are not supported by any reliable science and
If enacted, these policies could force more doctors away from treating pain, resulting in more illegal drug use and suicides.  

Furthermore, I find it discrimatory for anyone to try to limit opioid prescription medications their treating physician prescribes, as every pain patient metabolized medications differently and  should be treated individually based on their health needs. 

It's also discriminating to stereotype ANY patient as ""high-risk"" without knowing their ailments and medical history. 
 If they are prescribed gabapentin/pregabalin with opioids, as from experience, Gabapentin relieves the burning nerve pain and opioids relieve the pinching, stabbing, aching, throbbing and other excruciating pains. 

If they are prescribed a benzodiazepine like clonazepam and have good reason (ie, PTSD, anxiety diagnosis) you should not discrimate and stereotype them as an addict and deny them the quality of life we all deserve to have... freedom from torturous constant debilitating pain.

I am the Medical Director for Palliative & Supportive Care at Orlando Health UF Health Cancer Center (OH-UFHCC). I serve on the Board of the American Academy of Hospice & Palliative Medicine (AAHPM). I chair the American Medical Association (AMA) Pain & Palliative Medicine Specialty Section Council and have served on the AMA's Opioid Task Force for the last 3 years.

90 MORPHINE MILLIGRAM EQUIVALENT (MME) LIMIT

Clinical Concerns

My patients suffer from severe cancer pain; their analgesic dosing is highly individualized and many require higher doses than 90 MME to achieve control of their cancer pain within accepted standards for palliative care. Adoption of a 90 MME limit will prevent many from achieving sufficient control of their cancer pain.

About 73% of cancer outpatients report difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions, half of these due to delays from requests for prior authorization [Kollas CD, Boyer-Kollas B. J Pain Sympt. Management, Feb 2018;55(2):663-4]. CMS directs sponsors to ""continue to apply specifications to account for known exceptions, such as hospice care; cancer diagnoses,"" but is unclear if exceptions will apply to cases ""previously determined to be medically necessary"" or if additional determination will be required. CMS should create an explicit exception or exemption to specify that an opioid is being prescribed ""for the treatment of cancer-related pain"" or ""for a patient enrolled in hospice care"" to prevent further delays in treatment for vulnerable patients.

Health Policy Concerns

CMS improperly legitimizes a 90 MME per day limit for opioids, which lacks an accepted scientific basis. The CDC Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain mysteriously included this limit after the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) rejected it via an unsolicited petition by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, PROP (www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/2048.pdf). Notably, PROP included no experts in hospice and palliative care. 

CDC's inclusion of the 90 MME limit into the CDC Guidelines led to criticism from the AMA and AAHPM for a lack of transparency (www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2015/9/21/prop-helped-draft-cdc-opioid-guidelines), leading to a second open comment period. Ultimately, CDC exempted vulnerable populations, such as those receiving hospice and/or palliative care, who often require opioid doses exceeding the 90 MME limit. Including the 90 MME limit from the CDC Guidelines would mistakenly grant credibility to a false concept of an objective opioid limit. 


STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ABOUT FLAGS FOR GABAPENTIN AND PREGABALIN	

Efficacy & Off-Label Usage

Gabapentin is useful in treating cancer pain adjuvantly or alternatively to opioids. CMS proposes ""additional flags for high risk beneficiaries who use ""potentiator"" drugs (such as gabapentin and pregabalin) in combination with prescription opioids,"" citing ""increasing use of gabapentin for off-label indications, despite the lack of evidence from clinical trials,"" and that ""gabapentin is FDA-approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and the treatment of partial onset seizures."" Gabapentin is useful in treating neuropathic cancer pain and scientific evidence supports its off-label use: ""Gabapentin provides pain relief of a high level in about a third of people who take it for painful neuropathic pain"" [Moore RA et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rvw. 2014 April 27;(4);CD007938] and ""oxycodone/naloxone added to pregabalin or gabapentin provided additional relief and symptom control... without clinically significant safety concerns"" (Kim BS, et al. Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Dec 27. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12822).

Overuse

I have experienced only one case of overuse of gabapentin to relieve cancer-related pain in the last 17 years, corrected after an informed discussion about proper dosing. I have never experienced diversion involving gabapentin or pregabalin.

7-DAY LIMIT ON OPIOIDS FOR INITIAL FILLS

I am least concerned about a 7-day supply limit for ""initial fills of prescription opioids for the treatment of acute pain."" To avoid confusion, I strongly recommend that CMS add clear language that exempts patients with cancer-related pain or patients receiving hospice care from the 7-day supply limit for opioid prescriptions.	

CONCLUSION

I am very concerned that the CMS Proposed Opioid Rules will have profound negative consequences for many cancer patients. I recommend eliminating a 90 MME per day limit, which lacks a basis in science, and I urge CMS to create an explicit exemption for patients receiving hospice care or treatment of cancer-related pain to mitigate potential harm from these proposed rules.

These medications work on the pain receptors and do not create a sense of euphoria, we are not the ones overdosing and adding to the increase in the rate of addiction. Addiction specialists will tell you that there's a difference between addiction and dependence.

Carefully reconsider your decision regarding this decision. The ramifications have a grave impact on the chronic pain community who are already suffering.

"878","CMS",FALSE,6,NA,NA,"Hi!

I guess I should put a label on myself.
I am a Disabled Crime Victim. I am also speaking on behalf of family members who are Cancer Patients, Elderly Citizens - 90 and 96, and Degenerative Bone-Loss Sufferers.

These people are so bed-bound that they can't come on here and comment to stick up for themselves while other people make decisions for them by proxy.

I am AGAINST this PROPOSAL - Count me as a NO VOTE and here is why:

Ok... so, Cap Rates - If the the result you are looking for is all of the disabled people listed above, commiting suicide, having heart attacks, seeking medicine on the black market, being bed bound from lack of mobility, loss of family and loving relationships, burdoning the family members of those disabled people, sedintary lifestyles, early death, tortured end of life, and of course PAIN, etc then Capitation Rates will certainly do that.
CMS has been informed many times about the increase in quality of life, family engagement, mobility, travel, happiness, overall health, and of course PAIN, etc.

We, disabled people, are not making these Prescription level choices by ourselves. We are being monitored closely and giving detailed reports every month as to our conditions to 2 doctors because we are required by law to have a specialist. 
We are required to be under close scrutiny.
We are required to give monthly Urine Tests, the same way people on probation and parole are treated with skepticism.
We follow all of the extra rules closely like, not being allowed to change pharmacies and find a better price or looking for a different care provider for better or different treatment or a second opinion.
We don't complain or rock the boat for fear of being abandoned as a patient.
We are treated with Distrust and Suspicion no matter our age or criminal history or lack there of.
We are constantly under attack with new proposed regulations on Regulations.Gov, being criticized for taking a medication that works very well for us, all because there are bad people in the world that like to huff paint, sniff glue, and abuse drugs.
WE ARE NOT CRIMINALS and yet.... WE ARE TREATED AS SUCH.

NOW.... someone wants to get personally involved in the decision and recommendations of our doctors. Someone who is most likely NOT licensed in our State to Practice medicine. Knowing all of the various class-action lawsuits on Pharmaceutical Drug makers in US. Courts throughout time, you are actually considering a ONE-SIZE FITS ALL plan for many people with many different conditions.
As Court Cases and Medical Evidence has shown, this is a Horrible Idea!
Many people have different tolerances for pain. There is medical evidence that some people have a low threshold for pain and a High tolerance for Opioids, GENETICALLY.

Cap Rates continued -  If the result you are looking for is the end of the Opioid Epidemic, this is NOT a solution. This will have literally NO effect on Opioid Drug abuse.  The Production of Prescription Opioids and the U.S. Supply has steadily declined by mandate of the DEA, as you are well aware, for the last 10 yrs yet Opioid Overdoses has risen. (Refer to Graph included).
Why is that? Because your problem is NOT Prescription Opioids. You problem is Illicit Opioids such as Heroin and Illicit Fentanyl (NOT Prescription Fentanyl). The DEA themselves say that leas than 2% of Prescriptions make their way to the black market.(Excerpt included)

To wrap this up, I will just list some of the injuries I have sustained that require me to have MORE THAN a 90 mme per day opioid based medicone treatment:
Head injury, Brain Injury, 1 month Coma, Broken Neck (C7), Crushed Torso/Thoracic - 9 Ribs right front//6 Ribs left front//5 Ribs right back, Broken Collar Bone left, 3 Broken Wrist Bones right (3screws), 4 Broken Wrist Bones left (3screws), Broken Knee Cap left, Partically Cracked Sternum center, Cracked Cranium right side, Shattered Arm upper right (Rod and 4 screws), Detatached and Lesion/Lacerations forearm near elbow (skin graphs, large gaping hole 2screws), Lung Collapsed right Contusions/Lacerarions, Rotary Cuff Left, Rotary Cuff right (arms spun around backwards and dislocated), Foot ""Taco'd"" Broken  in half (Carpels) right, Broken Ankle right.
Proven in court federal, I have permanent injuries, won litigation, granted permanent full long term disability.

Note:
If you are serious, you should probably talk to the DEA for not locking up the people who brought these drugs in to our country in the first place. Their budget was $2.1 Billion in 2017 and have an Efficiency rate of less than 1% at Intercepting the flow of Drugs. Doctors and 90 yr old Grandmas are not the source of the Opioid Epidemic.

Maybe one should look at the largest exporter of Heroin in the world, which I will not name here. I mean...if you're actually serious about ending the illegal opioid trade and its effects on American children and adults, that is....

"880","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies, and 2019 draft Call Letter.
 
The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support, and research. Today, there are more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's, and it is the only cause of death among the top 10 without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. As the size and proportion of the United States population age 65 and older continue to increase, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias will grow. Caring for individuals with Alzheimer's cost an estimated $259 billion in 2017 with Medicare and Medicaid bearing $175 billion--67 percent--of that figure.  Thus, we encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to consider the following comments to improve both payment accuracy and care for this growing population of beneficiaries.
 
CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model for CY 2019
We support CMS's ongoing efforts to improve its risk adjustment model. We note that two dementia HCCs appear in the All Condition Count Model but not in the Payment Model. Merely counting dementia fails to account for the impact that dementia has on the management of other chronic conditions and the resulting increased costs to the system. Similarly, CMS has determined that the All Count Model improves accuracy for beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions but the Payment Model is more accurate for those with fewer chronic conditions. While most Medicare beneficiaries do not have so many co-occurring chronic conditions, 26 percent of beneficiaries over 65 with dementia have five or more of these conditions.  This results in higher than average per-person payments for most health care services for Medicare beneficiaries with dementia and serious coexisting medical conditions.  Given these increased costs and the growing population of beneficiaries who will have some form of dementia, we urge CMS to consider ways to account for the costs associated with these individuals. Additionally, plans that serve the sickest beneficiaries may experience a negative disproportionate impact without appropriate risk adjustment.

Existing Display Measure: Antipsychotic Use in Persons with Dementia (APD) (Part D)
The Alzheimer's Association appreciates CMS's ongoing efforts to reduce inappropriate antipsychotic use in persons with dementia. Historically, antipsychotic medications have been used appropriately and inappropriately to address some of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, aggression, and hallucinations. The Association fully supports that for all BPSD, non-pharmacologic interventions should be a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapies. However, the Association continues to support the appropriate use of medications when BPSD pose a greater risk to individuals and families living with dementia than the medications. 

Persons with dementia and families acknowledge the potential benefits of appropriately-used antipsychotics, even if the medication does not have an FDA-approved indication for their symptoms. They report that such medications can ease paranoia or anxiety and can alleviate the rage some people experience, keeping them and others safe and allowing them to remain in their homes. These medications may calm an agitated person for a few hours, allowing him or her to attend an adult day program, granting a caregiver a few hours of respite. Many persons with dementia and their families can make informed choices regarding the use of antipsychotic medications. This measure does not account for this informed consent, preference, and the potential improvements in the quality of life for some individuals. 

We strongly support CMS's decision to further examine diagnosis data and current use before adding the measure to the Star Ratings system.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. The Alzheimer's Association would be glad to serve as a resource to CMS as it considers these important issues and how they relate to individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias.

"882","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have an incomplete spinal cord injury called adhesive Arachnoiditis. This was the result of medical error during a procedure to remove scar tissue. It causes intractable pain which feels like constant burning and stabbing  pain. I also have a spondylolisthesis which is a slipping of one vertebrae over the other.  The nerve damage from the adhesive Arachnoiditis has spread to my pelvic organs which now have constant burning pressure like pain. I have already had 2 spinal surgeries and I am not a candidate for another surgery to have my spondylolisthesis corrected because it would cause the Arachnoiditis to progress. My doctors told me that I would need pain medicine for the rest of my life. I have spent tens of thousands of  dollars out of pocket trying every alternative, complimentary therapy available. I am on many other medications to manage my conditions and to keep my pain medicine dose till a minimum. 

I have been on pain medicine for 5 years now and I am on a high dose of medication that takes the edge off of the pain so I can take care of my hygiene,  and live an independent life with minimal activity. I have no side effects our any signs of addiction. 

Please do not limit the dose of daily opioid medicine as the results would be disastrous for me. I would no longer be functional, would be bedbound in agony. Every patient is different in terms of the metabolism of medication. A cutoff of 90 MME would cause immeasurable suffering for the approximately 10 million intractable pain sufferers in our country. 

Intractable pain patients do not divert their medication as it is so important to manage their pain.  Setting a 90 MME daily limit will not save anyone from overdose. 

Please do the right thing. Thank you.

The current proposed changes are confusing and worrying that there is not going to be exemptions for patients receiving hospice, who have active cancer, or who are receiving palliative care. Please clarify that, and make sure that our patients have access to these critically important medicines without having to jump through persistent and onerous prior authorizations, threats of having the medications discontinued, etc.

In addition to that, while I think it's appropriate to put policies in place to reduce the exposure of opioid-naive patients to opioids (eg by putting policies in place aimed at reducing the quantity of opioids patients are given/exposed to acutely after an injury or surgery), the whole idea of arbitrarily limiting opioids in large number of patients with chronic pain to 90mg morphine equivalents is not at all based in any real science. Instead it the opinion of a small number of pain/addiction doctors that does not reflect the opinion or practice of many of us who care for patients with complex chronic pain within and outside palliative care environments. It is an arbitrary number that is not based in high quality clinical research, and so adopting it without having any sense of the effects of it seems really extreme and dangerous. Chronic pain patients on opioids are some of the most highly monitored and scrutinized patients in medicine and they should not be punished in an effort to restrict opioids for acute pain.

Additionally, this is happening at a time when deaths from prescription opioids are plummeting the last several years (opioid deaths are obviously rising, but most of that seems to be from heroin and illegal fentanyl and no longer prescription opioids). 

Regulations like this, even when they give exceptions and ways to appeal, are interpreted by many clinicians that this is something that should *never* happen. Ie, the regulation says high dose opioid use should be rare for most patient contexts - that is true for sure, but putting barriers in place like this lead many clinicians to stop prescribing completely, or forcing patients who have demonstrated improvement and safety on opioids to taper off, harming them. Ie, 'rare with exceptions' becomes never. I have already met many patients who had demonstrated years of safe and beneficial use who are being forced off a previously successful therapy because their primary care or pain clinic basically said we are *never* going to do this. It's complicated, of course, many patients on high doses would do better with tapering off, I get that I do it all the time, but increasing regulations like this mostly serves to punish and screw the small number of patients who continue to benefit safely. Please don't do this.

"886","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Attached the Puerto Rico Healthcare Community Letter signed by 25 public and private entities and key constituents of Puerto Rico's health system, which agree that (1) there is an anomalous historic situation that makes MA rates in Puerto Rico uniquely low; and (2) HHS and CMS should take immediate administrative action to make meaningful adjustments that can mitigate the harmful funding gap for MA in Puerto Rico. 

Multiple community organizations, including the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage Products Association of Puerto Rico (MMAPA), have presented new proposals, evidence, and updated analysis to support a meaningful positive adjustment in the MA rates for Puerto Rico counties in 2019. 

Main Proposals include:

1.	HHS and CMS should use administrative flexibility to meaningfully adjust MA rates in Puerto Rico for CY2019 in the Final Announcement and Call Letter for CY2019, after recognizing new evidence of data anomalies and the harmful effects of the recent natural disaster.

2.	HHS and CMS should establish a proxy methodology for the 2019 MA benchmark or a national floor for the Average Geographic Adjustment (AGA floor) of 0.70 for all counties in MA rate-setting. The latter would move PR counties to an AGA closer to other Caribbean Territories and protect all the counties in the Nation from cases of extremely low AGAs resulting from clear data deficiencies and fluctuations. Implementing an AGA floor now will prevent further erosion and irreparable harm to the healthcare system.  A similar approach should be used to calculate the ESRD benchmark to ensure resources are available to properly care for this vulnerable population. 

3.	CMS can phase-in the impact of the proposed policy for MA benchmarks in a period of 2-3 years, starting in 2019, and monitor closely the effects on the system. MA plans in Puerto Rico are committed to work with CMS in defining additional bid requirements, bid to benchmark ratio parameters or monitoring tools to measure the impact of the adjustment in relation to provider compensation and development of value-based payment models. 

4.	County rates in Puerto Rico are such outliers in 2018 that the level of payment proposed would still leave them at least 15% or more below the average MA rates in the state with the lowest average. The additional funding will provide the necessary inflow to support recovery efforts for our health system while remaining as the lowest cost option in the Nation and will also help address migration of providers and patients, ultimately avoiding unnecessary costs to the Federal government.

5.	Puerto Rico has higher costs of living than the US average. The unsustainably low pricing of health care is partly the result of historic anomalies in Medicare that continue to push compensation down, while accommodating increases in the price of other inputs like prescription drugs. There is precedent in CMS regulation of the use of proxy factors and alternative methods when data elements of a statutory formula are simply not present or deficient. Puerto Rico MA rates after the ACA are a clear case, and a step to break the spiral to the bottom is needed now more than ever. Given the socio-economic scenario, and the recent natural disaster, Puerto Rico MA plans are also increasingly spending additional resources to tackle social determinants of health. Transportation, care coordination, community outreach are efforts that have become harder and costlier, but also more important for MA beneficiaries in PR.

6.	The Puerto Rico Community is appreciative of policy adjustments already taken by the Administration. We support CMS proposal to continue to provide Puerto Rico plans special consideration due to the program inequities in the Star rating measure, in particular the proposed hold harmless methodology due to the impact of the natural disaster.  We also support that the zero claim adjustment implemented in 2017 and 2018 remain until a temporary solution to the data anomalies can be implemented.  Finally, we also support the 2018 decision to assign double bonus status to most counties in the Island and would request CMS to evaluate expanding the policy to cover all 78 municipalities.  However, new evidence studied this past year suggests that these current adjustments are far from enough. The continued deterioration requires a higher-impact policy action to stop the harmful and increasing funding gap. Simultaneously, we continue to work with other persisting anomalies, unique to Puerto Rico in Medicare FFS, such as the use of the SSI indicator and the wage index fix in Part A.

With the fair and needed adjustments we have been proposing, there is no doubt Puerto Rico can continue to make progress towards operating the most cost-effective high quality MA and Part D programs in the Nation.

I went through almost an entire year of physical therapy, but I have lost so much muscle mass, that this did not work for me.  Most chores and daily living is pretty difficult.  I have been completely compliant in every way.  I have done everything my doctors have asked.  I have abided by all the rules and all the suggestions and have attended all my appointments.  The policies that are proposed and the studies that were done did not include the chronically ill patients.  Those of us are suffering and are at high risk for heart attack and stroke and even death.  Unfortunately, those that are in high amounts of pain, higher than me, may choose suicide, and some have already.  How very sad that no one has considered the lives of us.  I was born with these conditions.  Chiari 1 Malformation and Lupus are inherited conditions.  Any of my children could have these conditions.  I do not wish for them to suffer as I have suffered.  Please take into consideration what I have said and the many that are suffering and dying.  Think about your own family members who are sick... and if they are not, what if they become sick.  What if they have a car accident today.  What if they get word they have cancer today.  What if they inherited a condition like me.  Think about that... it hits home very quickly.

I cannot stress enough how much this scares me. I am NOT an ADDICT. Most people who are geniunly in Pain are not Addicts. So how is it fair to punish those who truly need these meds. U can't say so and so can only get so and so mgs for this medicine. People have diff thresholds and tolerances. How can u possibly say somone cannot have more then this amount? What about US? What about people like me who do not abuse meds. It took forever for me to find the right meds and b/c of the fakers and abusers, people in geniune pain are suffering. Drs are terrified to give u anything. I cannot tell u how much this will effect people in severe pain. I have FIbromyalgia along with many other issues.The pain in FIbro is, in my case at least, is SEVERE. Ive had it over 20 years. I have been on every med u can think of for Fibro and NOT narcotics and nothing helped! Once I was prescribed opoids, I could actually have some quality of life. I have 2 kids to take care of and Im a single mom. Some people just have strong tolerance and Im one of those people. Its always been that way. Ive been on the same mgs for my pain meds for years, at least 5 w/ no increase. So,yes, Im hurting more b/c pain has literally spread and is worse and u do grow a tolerance. But thats what these meds are made for! People who are in SEVERE CHRONIC pain 24/7. I didn't get the slightest high when I started. First few days a little drowsy, but that was it b/c I take them as Prescribed. If I was an addict, I would be out of pills in a week or two. I do have to take advil here and there but people in chronic pain cannot take advil and tylenol on a regular basis. Thats why these were made to begin with. I have to use a cane when I get up and im 40. Even after my muscles loosen up, I have severe fatigue, chronic migraines, Chronic anxiety, chronic nausea (literally im nauseated everyday), excessive sweating, hyothyroidism, reflux, ibs, and of course the ""knots"" which are the absolute most painful thing are all over my body, especially my back. I have a special tool I have to use with knobs all over it, It helps me to hit those knots in my back to release the trigger and tender points b/c not only do i have fibro, i have myofacial pain syndrome and Chronic Fatigue syndrome. Some say CFS and FIbro are the same. I don't know. All I know is everyday I literally feel flu like symptoms w/ body aches X100 and severe muscle pain and muscle is everywhere so i hurt everywhere. U tell me who could go through this day after day minute by minute, with out effective pain control and want to live. The only reason I am still on this earth is b/c of my kids, my faith and my meds. Im a single mom with two kids and both have learning disabilities, ADHD, OCD and other issues. My son is bipolar like his dad. He is extremely difficult. My daughter has problems as well. The stress in my life is crazy which in turn makes me in a flare basically everyday. I know the addiction problem is nuts. But if you watch any show about addicts, they say once they couldn't get pills anymore, they started getting heroin b/c it was easy to get and cheaper. So, taking our pain meds away is just going to increase meth and herion amongst addicts. That is a hell of a lot worse. I also know the suicide rate of fibro sufferes is already high.I have certainly thought about it to be honest. U take our only hope of living a somewhat decent life and it wil increase. This article scares me to death. Not every person on pain meds is an addict! But when people talk about the opiod crisis, they don't ever mention that there are people who need it and take it properly. We do exist! U take that away from me, u are taking my kids mom away. I will not be able take care of them if I can't get out of bed and take care of myself.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0073","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Terri Waldron-SC"
"892","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"So, what exactly is your mission? Is it only to reduce the number of opioid prescriptions written? If that's the case you are completely disregarding an entire group of people who live & suffer with severe chronic paina hellish life. Those with chronic pain conditions are being taken off the one medication (usually the last of many medications and several treatments tried) that gives them a semblance of life; work and purpose, without misery. This so-called epidemic has been spun completely out of control whereby the March 2016 CDC GUIDElines (a GUIDE created to rein in ILLEGAL opioid abuse/deaths; it is NOT a mandate) where fewer prescriptions are ALSO being written for those diagnosed with chronic pain. This means they are left to suffer (or die; some by suicide to end their misery). That's no different than being cut off from meds for other chronic conditions (i.e. heart, blood pressure, anxiety, diabetesFYI, these meds too can be abused). 

Please be AWARE, there are 2 distinct points of discussion surrounding opioids with completely different origins and completely different prevention and treatment modalities. Do not confuse the two! There are LEGAL PRESCRIPTION opioids used for acute and chronic pain. And there are ILLEGAL opioids used to get high and/or bring relief to physical and/or psychological pain. For this the criminal justice; Police and DEA must focus on. That is their job, not our doctor's job. 

Drug abuse PREVENTION and TREATMENT strategies, proper MENTAL HEALTH CARE and adequate PAIN CONTROL/TREATMENT come into play, but you can see all are woefully lacking in America and it's getting WORSE! 
Chronic pain needs attention, care, compassion and treatment, including opioids. Illegal drugs and their abuse need thorough identification, investigation and the criminals stopped. The addicts need proper medical care; identification and treatment, including mental health services. Everyone needs COMPASSION!

Severe crohns. Damage was done. I have battled this disease 28 years. I've come off 3 death beds at 59 pounds each time, organs shutting down. This is a very painful disease and there is no cure. The pain is compared to full blown labor contractions that get more frequent and more severe. The pain is unbearable. I've lived in pain many years. I now have over 6 auto immune disorders that spun from crohns and harsh medications. Not pain meds, chemo class medications. I have no choice. I am a mom. This has spun off ITP, UC, severe osteoporosis  (age18) youngest person to be put on reclast infusions. I have esophageal strictures,  soon to be diagnosed a rare rhemotology disorder causing the esophagus to get strictures. I have now, neuropathy,  Fibromyalgia,  Rhematoid arthritis,  and degenerative disk disease I went through every type of treatment,  physical therapy,  after all meds were failing. It was at the end of physical therapy that they stated there was nothing more that they could do. The spine,  crushing on bones is painful. They released me and then sent me to pain management. I sit here now,  as I type to say, I had my life snatched at a young age. 18. My life, my career, all gone. 2 years NA, nursing, gone. Fully disabled. 1997. My work was not enough credits due to being so young. I am on SSI Disability and I recieve Medicaid.  I am limited to 5 prescriptions a month. One, is a chemo class infusion done by hospital, over  $3000 to keep me in remission just for Crohns disease. It does not help with my other debilitating illnesses/diseases. That brings me to 4 meds a month. Only one is under $4 plan at Wal-Mart. I have several meds it's hard to balance. I have to pick and choose which one I need more. I recently in the past month, am at my highest weight ever in my life. 105 pounds. I only wanted to look normal. I've never been over 82 pounds until now. The pain management has helped me. I am not a addict. I am dependant. Without my Pain med, I cannot function. No quality of life at all. Head to toe pain. I cannot stand, cook clean.  I've lost family, I've lost my life young. I became a mom, with two miracle babies. I then had a purpose in life. I've fought for my health and life so long now. I have done this because I am a mother. Single disabled mom. My boys only have me. My kids have suffered enough. I ask to please think of other ways to resolve the opioid crisis. Many, like myself. Did not choose this life. I can assure you.. this is not a glamorous lifestyle.  I am only asking, please.. do not take what I have left. I only want to be a mom. To cook my boys dinners, and to clean and run our living. The medicine which is diladid, has given me back, being a mother. Now, because of pain management finding the right med and dose. I have this part of my life back. I know there is a very vauge line between dependant and addiction. I started knowing,  I take ""when needed"" not by habit. I refuse to become a addict. My father died of alcoholism,  yet liquor is not being touched. I do not drink bc my father was killed tragically bc of it. That was a addiction. Anything can become a addiction. Pulling patients like myself. Cancer patients .. ones with lifelong chronic pain will not solve the issue. Yet, I do and wish to not be catoragized with the addicts. Please do not put us all under the same umbrella. It's inaccurate and wrong. I lock my meds up in a lockbox. No kids will ever get into. Why? Because I know things can happen. I will not put temptation out there. Please, do not go about this crisis the wrong way. Do not punish those of us who need in order to live. Again, What will happen if a tragedy hits any of You?  You would not let a loved one suffer, nor yourself. Life happens. Things happen. I'm sorry, but God does give us these hurdles in life. Not for the weak. It can happen to you, your child, your family. No-one should suffer. We deserve to be treated as real patients. Not seekers. This proposal of releasing a certain amount of my meds will mean I will lose more meds. 5 a month. One is chemo. Leaves me with 4 a month and a good dozen prescriptions, that I try and balance out, including Doctor visits. Limited ER visits,  and outpatient and impatient visits and stays. I do my monthly mandatory federal ""randoms "" and I do not enjoy it, but I go.  I prove every month, what I take, and I walk the correct line. I was one that was grateful,  knowing this would narrow out the real seekers. I'm not one of them.

NO one wishes to lose a family member to drug overdose, I should know I lost a brother 14 years ago. I can say that no one in my family blames drugs and especially opioid medication for the death....of my brother. Death seems to be following, although very unreported , in the wake of the 100 milligrams maximum, per day, dosage of a morphine equivalent opioid medication. Patients such as my self, with years and decades of documented beneficial use and the benefit FAR outweighing any perceived harm. It was the LAST effective treament for my particular pain generating issues, 23 years ago. I am now unemployed (59 years of age), not sociably interactive and entering a clinical depression not felt since I realized that continuous pain was to be a partt, a big part of my life over two decades ago. The sanctioning of the medication I have been prescribed, without increase for 6 years, has been interupted without any justification, as if that matters. It is reported through CDC that some 56,000 people overdosed in 2015. One full year after medication sanctioning began at the first of 2017, months before, for our Veterans, the drug overdose numbers rose to some 66,000 in 2017 even with millions of less opioid medication prescriptions being issued. Sanctioning of opioid medication is NOT reducing drug overdose. Isn't that EXACTLY what the ""opioid crisis"" is about? AS ususal, many must suffer so that it seems that soemthing is being accomplished with the unacceptable numbers that the ""opioid crisis"" blamed on prescribed medication has ""statred"". There is NO truth in sanctioning opioid medication to ALL patients with incurable pain issues will help reduce drug overdose now.......or ever. Patients are being persecuted with non manageable pain that has been managed for millions of us, for years and decades. It seems that ""debate"" on the issue is not being accepted from our physicians OR especially from the ones most affected by medication denial and sanctioning.......the patients. WE HAVE documentaton of the benefits that opioid medicatioin CAN result in but, who is listenng? To simply deny, sufficient medication in a tailored dosage to each individual patient without ANY other Effective resource for pain managment other than shady companies looking to make a buck with different ""oils"" and powdered or leafed substances leaving the patient abandoned for appropriate treatment causing death by suicide would seem wrong to me but, the experts, not my doctor would know best........right.

"896","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Comments on the CMS Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls in Medicare Part D; The parameters for identifying potential opioid overutilizers are somewhat explained, but are not totally clear.  It appears to be primarily exceeding an MME, maximum morphine equivalent limit.  The MME in the CDC guidelines was never meant to be applied to long term chronic pain patients as a hard formulary limit.  The CDC guidelines to the best of my knowledge from studying them at the time were guidelines for primary care doctors not hard formulary limits for treating long term chronic pain.  The exclusion for ""beneficiaries with cancer or in hospice"" is inadequate.  One disease should not be excluded from review, there are many diseases as painful as cancer and the people with those diseases should not be told that their disease is less painful than cancer.  CMS should consider adding palliative care to their exclusion.  People on palliative care have many different chronic painful diseases that will never resolve until death and the patient maybe on palliative care for many years before reaching the ""status"" of being in hospice.

The proposal regarding Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines could case distress for some beneficiaries.  People with long term chronic pain need restorative sleep to be functional and many have taken an opioid and a benzodiazepine safely for many, many years without complication and will now be told that it may be denied to them and they will have to make a choice, one or the other.

The proposals regarding implementing a hard-formulary limit of 90 MME and an initial fill of an opioid for treatment of acute pain for the opioid naive, will cause a lot of confusion with patients, doctors and probably also pharmacists.  Who is in charge of the patient's care?  The doctor, the plan sponsor or the pharmacist?  There is an attempt to explain this better later in the document, but it is not clear to me at this time.  People will be put in distress who have had a major surgery, have a 7 day prescription and are not having a 7 day recovery.  People who are in wheelchairs or on walkers or their caregivers will have to get to a pharmacy more than once to get adequate medication to recover from a surgery or procedure. And if they are denied the 2nd 7 day refill, they will be faced with no medication or paying for it out of pocket or self-medicating with alcohol or other drugs because the pain is under-treated. Nurses that are doing home care are already seeing this.  It is also not discussed in the proposal what the patient will have to pay, a co-pay for the first fill, then again for the second if approved? Another group at risk are people who are in pain and have no diagnosis.  Pain is a symptom and the cause not always easily diagnosed, in our household, it was a tow and a half year battle to get a correct diagnosis for our family member's painful condition due to a genetic mutation.  People in this unfortunate situation should not be left hanging with inadequate pain management if a diagnosis is elusive.  It is often forgotten that people do indeed die of being in pain.

It is also somewhat disturbing to me that benficiaries who have never gone to more than one prescriber and not gone to more than one pharmacy could be targeted as being ""chronic over users"" just because someone thinks their level of pain medication is beyond an arbitrary hard formulary limit.  Many states including CO have a PDMP, which collects the data on all dispensed opioid prescriptions and produces a report to doctors on patients that go to multiple doctors and multiple pharmacies.  But this information does not appear to satisfy CMS anymore.  The implication on page 205 is that in 2019 anyone over 90 MME will or can be targeted, no matter what their medical condition.  If you are going to discontinue statistics over 120 MME, you seem to have already decided on a hard formulary limit for everybody at 90.

According to this document plan beneficiaries are targeted and reported by CMS to their plans, with the encouragement to the plan sponsor to reduce the number of beneficiaries who happen to use higher doses of opioids, no matter what the painful disease.  I would ask CMS to also track statistics on death from being in pain and track suicides by people under-treated for pain.  The document mentions reducing the potential for unintended consequences, but in my opinion talks more about targeting people with painful conditions in the quest for having statistics that show lower opioid use in Medicare.  Where is the medical code for Quality of Life and Functionality?  It does not appear to me to exist in CMS.

"903","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I've been suffering from a condition called trigeminal neuralgia type ll for 14 years, it's also called the suicide disease. Because of this disability I'm on Medicare. I loved my career at The Boeing Company where I worked  for 15 years and I thought I would retire from, that is until trigeminal neuralgia entered my life. I was living a normal, happy life, owned my own home, great job, tons of friends, went camping, fishing, hiking, and great social life- it was all gone in an instant. On March 5, 2004 I felt a pain in my face unlike anything I've ever felt before, it wasn't even comparable to a toothache, headache or giving birth. My face feels like it's on fire, being stabbed over and over by an ice pick, pulling and gnawing, electrical shocks, an ice pack stuck and won't come off, live volt shocks, hot iron, these pains occurred at the same time and still occur today, 24/7/365, with the help of opioids the pain is eased.

Three years into my illness and after trying over 20 different treatments including two brain surgeries, all of my doctors including pain management suggested trying opioid medication. I was reluctant to try it, holding out hope for improved treatments and/or medications. Before I even started the opioid I made it my goal to stop it as soon as I could. In the intervening years and in my quest for other treatment options, I either had adverse effects to other medications or I didn't quality for treatments. Prior to getting trigeminal neuralgia I was very healthy and barely took an aspirin. However I needed relief from this horrific and excruciating pain. I was already taking anti-seizure medications, but they weren't helping enough with the trigeminal neuralgia pain, I was still in excruciating pain. I tried the opioid and I couldn't believe how much of a difference it made in lowering my pain. I hear a lot of discussion about people needing opioid increases because of their tolerance level, but I find that not to always be true. I've talked to quite a few people that have never needed to increase their opioid medication and I've never needed an increase either. 

I felt like a new person and finally life was worth living again. I could now buy my own groceries, not have a heating pad stuck to my face 24/7/365 and the best part was being able to attend holidays with my family- something I hadn't been able to do for 14 years. Granted I still don't have a life and I never will, unless a cure is found.  I am thankful everyday that my pain has eased and I don't think about killing myself.

Having and enforcing the same opioid medication cap for everyone simply does not work. Everyone metabolisms medications differently and having a cap on opioid medications will allow my insurance company to deny my medication. As it is doctors are scared to write opioid prescriptions, and I know people whose doctors have directed them to the emergency department because their doctor is too scared to write opioid prescriptions.

Chronic pain patients want to live their lives in the least amount of pain as possible. Chronic pain patients don't sell their opioid medications or leave it around for it to be stolen. Granted there is a small portion, smaller that 4% who abuse the privilege of being prescribed opioids, but it's not the true chronic pain patient.

Please let chronic pain patients live and don't force them to the streets looking for pain relief or make a suicide plan! Chronic pain patients don't want to die, but with the excruciating pain that they have, they need some sort of pain relief. Chronic pain patient's did not ask to be put in these situations. They would do anything to be out enjoying a simple walk in the park with their better half, a nice lunch out, or share a joke with a friend-if they still have friends. Everyday chronic pain patients wish and pray their situations were different. 

Chronic pain patients understand the opioid crisis and that there are some doctors who over-prescribe opioids and scrupulous ""pain patients"". What chronic pain patients are asking for is to continue receiving opioid medications as written by their doctor, and dispensed without interference by the government, insurance companies or pharmacies. 
WILL YOU PLEASE HELP US LIVE! WE DON'T WANT TO DIE!
Thank you for your consideration!

"906","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Comments on Part I
With respect to the changes proposed to the Part C risk adjustment model, our organization (Fallon Health - contract H9001) believes CMS should delay phase in of a new model until after 2019. We believe it is important for CMS to wait until full ICD-10 data is available to evaluate in the development of a new model. Also, the release of final MAO-004's for either the PY 2016 or PY 2017 encounter data models makes a full evaluation of any new encounter model impossible.
As CMS works to develop a revised model for future years as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, our organization is supportive of adding new disease conditions for mental health, substance use disorder and chronic kidney disease conditions to that model. We would support a proposal to add that as a small revision to the PY 2018 RAPS and EDS models. CMS should also consider the impact of any condition count model on plans, including D-SNP's, that serve the high needs of dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
We support the inclusion of RAPS inpatient diagnoses in any encounter data-based risk model.

Comments on Part II
Our organization opposes CMS' proposed methodology to calculate the Part C fee for service normalization factor. We recommend that the methodology used needs to more fully consider the impact of the greater specificity in diagnosis coding inherent in ICD-10. The increase in the actual FFS risk scores experience in 2016, the first full year of ICD-10 implementation, is highly unlikely to repeat itself when viewed in the context of actual year over year results prior to 2016. One approach to mitigating the impact of this single point is to utilize a linear methodology, but including experience back to 2011.

Using opioids for pain control, especially in hospice and end-stage care, was critical to allowing these dear people to pass in more peace and dignity. Let me ask: would you sit by and watch your loved oneyour child, your parent, your spouse, your dearest friendsuffer in unending agony for months, and die begging for relief, because someone in a Washington office decided not to make an exemption?

I have a different example for you. In 2018, I woke up in agonizing pain, and discovered after a trip to the emergency room that I had five swollen cervical and thoracic discs in my spine due to repetitive motion. I needed relief, and I was prescribed Tramadol. I took 8 pills a day for almost 2 months, then weaned myself off until I was able to manage my pain with over the counter medications. But there are people for whom this isn't an option, for whom the pain is torturous and unending, and they need to be able to manage their pain effectively. Are regulations necessary? Yes. But every person's medical situation is different, and some people need more care, not less. Just because I could heal in 2 months doesn't mean everyone canespecially since I had the luxury of being able to take off work long enough to properly heal. Most people can't. They don't have the resources.

You can't remove every safety net people rely upon in these situations and expect people to fit into neat boxes. Cutting people off from legitimate pain relief will only drive more people into illegal pain relief. 

And taking relief away from the dying is horrifying and cruel.

Limiting the quantity of medication we are able to obtain on a regular basis will cause unnecessary pain and suffering. It will force doctors to violate their Hippocratic Oath: FIRST DO NO HARM.

It will NOT prevent the ""opioid epidemic,"" because we're not the cause of it.

"919","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I do not believe an across the board 7 day opioid prescription limit makes sense. It takes away the discretion of doctors to give what they consider a proper dosage amount for the patient that they know and treat. I believe the doctors have the best relationship with the patient and their diagnosis to make the proper prescription. I believe by making them apply for exemptions makes their job even harder and will eventually force many of them to move away from doing pain management just because it would become more burdensome. I also believe this regulation would give more control to the insurance companies in denying prescriptions.  Even before this regulation, I had a dear friend diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer and was give 6 months to live. At one point she had run out of prescribed opioids and her insurance company would not refill until a certain date was met two weeks later, effectively causing my friend to undergo 14 days of more intense pain.  This was not death with dignity.  I understand that palliative care, cancer and some other conditions MAY or MAY NOT have exceptions.  The regulation doesn't provide a hard and fast answer. I do believe in my friends case that the insurance companies already show that they are willing to let patients sit in pain rather than renew a prescription. I also believe your currently proposed regulation gives those insurance companies more control over denying the prescriptions.  While I believe there is an increasing issue with opioid deaths and this is a serious issue I find this regulation throwing pain patients to the wolves in a far too widely felt regulation. A more precise and nuanced approach could help solve this issue without impacting people with long term disability or significant pain needs already being served by doctors.

I have adhesive spinal arachnoiditis, which has for years caused me to have severe neck, back and leg pain.  For years, I tried ""everything under the sun"" (other than opioids) to treat my pain and saw multiple doctors and was seen at multiple chronic pain clinics. Pain managment methods tried included physical therapy, epidural spinal steroid injections, and multiple trials of non-opioid oral medications. Nothing reduced my pain until finally, after some years I began to see a certified pain management doctor who put me on a longacting opioid (the fentanyl patch).  While I continue to have pain around the clock, it is substantially less since I am on the fentanyl patch, allowing me a much better quality of life and greatly improving my functioning and my continued ability to care for myself.  I have now been on the fentanyl patch at the same dose for some years, with no side effects, no need to increase the dose, no signs of tolerance or decreased effectiveness and no problem at all with any kind of ""addiction"".  I continue to see my pain management doctor every three months.  If Medicare causes me to have to take less of my medication for arbitrary reasons, I will once again be in increased pain, which in the past caused me to be unable to function.  I used to spend many days in a row at home, never going out, and don't want to return to that kind of life again.  The dose of fentanyl I take is not considered a very high dose relatively speaking (I am on fentanyl 50 mcg/hr patch, changed every 72hours), but it is  over any 90 morphine milliequivalent dose per day limit.  There is simply no reason at all for medicare to contradict my pain doctor's best recommendations, thereby forcing me to take less than the ideal amount of fentanyl to treat my problem.  As I know medicare is aware, the CDC guidelines do NOT advise restricting every patient on opioids to an amount less than or equal to 90 morphine milliequivalents per day.  The CDC guidelines advise caution if any doses higher than that are used, and my doctor and I have always been very cautious regarding my medication.  It would be unethical for medicare to override my doctor's recommended dose, and would sentence me to a life with a lot more pain, at no benefit to me whatsoever.  The CDC recommendations are a GUIDELINE, not a regulation, and again, do NOT advise that every patient on opioids take less than 90 MME per day.  Clearly, since I have been on this opioid at the same dose for some years, with no adverse effects at all, and since I am monitored so closely by my pain doctor, and always without fail take my medication exactly as prescribed, there is simply no justifiable reason to force me to take a dose lower than recommended by my physician.  Again, the dose of fentanyl I take is no where near the maxiumum recommended dose.    I wonder why Medicare would even consider overriding what a patient's personal physician recommends.  It doesn't make good common sense and is morally and medically wrong in the case of well-monitored chronic intractable pain patients.  I would also point out that the state of VA, where I live, has this year updated its regulations regarding the administration of opioids, and does not require any kind of morphine dose limit.  I would very much question WHY it would make any sense for medicare to contradict the advice of both my longtime certified pain management doctor and the laws/regulations of the state in which I live.

I am given random urine tests and I have monthly appointments where they monitor the medications I take, how much, and when. I have never misused this medication. I use this medication to have some semblance of life. I don't get high on pain medication; it's for pain, not for fun. It's not fun to be in pain every day.

I don't ask you to feel sorry for me, just understand that there are people who use pain medication for a reason other than getting high. Please hear the stories of people in pain. Many live in agony. Take away their medication and you take away their life.

If you do not live in pain every day of your life, count yourself very lucky. It can happen to anyone at any time. I was 40 when it happened to me, I am now 60. Twenty years of pain wreaks havoc on your soul. All I am asking is for people with chronic pain to be seen and heard. Not all pain medication is bad and not all people that take it are addicts, even though that has become the perception.

Elicit use of heroin and other illegal drugs like street fentanyl are the reason for most of the opioid epidemic, yet people who have had medication prescribed to them by their doctor are being blamed and called addicts. This has become a chronic pain crisis! 

There are thousands of stories. Many people are too ill to march or even write a letter. I can assure you, however, they are there, 100 million of them, sitting alone in the dark, and fearing their lives will change forever.

People with chronic pain have been made invisible and their opinions discounted regarding the decisions being made about pain medications. There are many pain doctors, many organizations like The Pain Advocate Coalition, and The National Pain Report that understand the issues of pain. They have gathered statistics that vary greatly from those that we hear on the T.V. and read in reports by the CDC.  I believe there is a huge discrepancy in how and why information is being reported.  For another perspective, please read the following:

This legislation would change many lives and not for the better. Please take the time to find out about people in chronic pain. Here are just a few stories of people in chronic pain. Please take the time to truly understand this issue before you change peoples lives forever. 

Seek out stories of people in pain and how pain medication has changed their lives. Hearing the whole story is the only way to make a decision that will help everyone. It's essential to hear personal stories before you make any decisions that will affect people in pain. Go to pain clinics, talk with people in pain if you truly want to understand what this could do to people who are just trying to live their lives.

There is NO one size fits all treatment for any type of illness or disorder, *especially* pain. And it has already been proven that the majority of overdoses come from drugs obtained from the streets anyway. It has already become almost impossible to find a doctor willing to prescribe pain medicine as it is. I am sorry that over 70k people a year choose to abuse drugs and die because of it. That was a choice *they* made. Over 1.5 million people in the USA alone rely on pain medicines-not to get high-but to be a productive citizen. To be able to work, or care for their kids or even to just be able to care for themselves! You are already causing people to choose suicide because they cannot tolerate the pain they are now faced with because they cannot get the treatment they need. Do you not see the trickle down effect of this? Those who will have to stop working? More ER visits. More people in the hospital. More filing for disability? Even the World Health Org. states that access to pain medication is a HUMAN RIGHT! Way more problems are caused in this world by alcohol! And it has no value as a medicine. Go ban that! But leave the medicines and the prescribing thereof to the Doctors, who actually see the patients face to face-and know what they need. One size fits all just doesn't work. I have Lupus. It is very painful. It destroys your organs. I am currently at the 90m limit. What am I supposed to do when my pain excedes that limit? And it will, before I die. Die in screaming pain? Because someone else screwed up and abused? Why should I or anyone have to pay for their crimes? It's a human right. To have access to needed pain medicine. And no one can determine that except me and my doctor. Because it is different for each and every human. Please allow us our right to live and die with dignity.

"932","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"On Feb. 28th I had a Laminotomy in three of my lumbar disc. The surgeon said there was a lot of compression in my vertebral canal causing that was causing me extreme nerve pain down my legs. I have no been able to walk without taking hydrocodone. I could get out of bed and wait until 10:00 am to take medication if I did not have things to do but other days I had to take it first thing in the morning. My pain had gotten so bad that I had to get permission from my pain management doctor to increase my dosage to four pills as day instead of three. I had my surgery and when I got out the incision started getting infected. I had to go to the emergency room. So, my pain after surgery has not decreased it has been the same or gotten worse. I fell asleep on my couch last night and I woke up and could not walk. My left leg was getting shooting pains in it. I could barely bend my leg. I had to wake my son up so he could help me get to bed. I had to use a cane. This has never happened to me. Something went wrong with my surgery or the infection was effecting it. I am writing all of this because when people suffer from spinal stenosis and other arthritic conditions in the back or neck pain medication is essential to have a somewhat normal life. Nerve pain is very debilitating.  

I am in pain management. I live in Virginia and most people have to go to pain management for long term opiate use for painful chronic conditions. I have urine screening, I have to bring my bottle of medication to my appointments. The nurse will count the pills to make sure I have to right amount. I take less than what the CDC's guidelines are. However, if my operation is not successful my need for medication could increase. The nerve pain is horrible because it can effect you when you lie down. 

I think that the state of Virginia has done a good job with  implementing their pain management requirements. I can only use one pharmacy. The hospitals have my medications on file. There is a network of practitioners that have all of my records so I cannot go from one doctor to the next getting pain pills. I think that addicts and illegal drugs have been causing the death toll to rise in other states but Virginia has not been to bad, so maybe someone see what we are doing right. 

Right now. I am under the morphine milligrams but if this nerve pain gets worse or I need another operation who knows how much pain that would be. There has to be limits , but some chronic conditions should be able to take more for pain.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0584","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Sharon Primerano-VA"

Opioids help me by managing my pain and help me be human again, I can walk without assistance, bathe without assistance, go to church, drive, go places without assistance, have an over all better quality of life.
If Medicare/Medicaid/private insurer refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME I will No longer be a functional human and go back to that sad human being that had no quality of life!

It is very unlikely my condition will improve and the effects of time and aging will make things worse. Opioids and pain management were my last resort /option.
Proposed policies are not supported by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.
These policies could:  create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services.
Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues.
I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls, lets me walk without assistance, bathe without assistance, drive, go places and have a higher quality of life.
My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.
A 7 day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain.

There are several million people in the U. S. who live with chronic pain diseases which rob us of the life that we had dreamed we would live. We have tried every option available in medication, injection, PT, massage, acupuncture, and after much trial and error, the opioids prescribed are the only effective treatment which allows me to interact with my family and not be confined to bed.  No individual patient needs the same dosage and our bodies metabolize these medications differently.  The maximum dosage of 90 mmg per day has already been tried and does not effectively relieve the 24 hour around the clock pain.  How are we to live our lives with the hard edits proposed and our doctors not making the decisions on our treatments?  They have tested, examined, seen the benefits, failures of medications and treatments and have worked to create individualized treatment plans.. These are complex and not one size fits all. It has taken us years to reach this point. We do not want to be subjected to  We need the individual customized treatment plan by our physicians who are formally trained to treat pain and understand how we respond.  They also know that we are not abusing our medications for pain and anxiety. These are vital for us to exist and function.  Both of these go hand in hand and we cannot be expected to survive in an atmosphere where insurance companies make these life and death decisions for us without knowledge of our problems and having known and worked with us on a treatment to be able to function, work, and provide for our families.
    In my case, I had several spinal cord simulators implanted, and these were not properly manufactured and failed which caused permanent nerve damage.It cannot be reversed.  This is recorded in your MAUDE data base .  This has worsened my pain and suffering of the diseases for which I have been diagnosed. There are countless numbers of people just like me that are not recognized for injuries such as these in addition to worsening our disease process.
   If we are forced to wait for a hard edit and the decision is made by an insurance company, then what will our future be?  How can we be expected to exist in the pain in which we will be forced to live?
   Having to get new prescriptions every 7 days will cause problems which are insurmountable. Many of us live in smaller cities and must travel to larger medical centers which have been treating me for many years and who have all of my records readily available in addition to knowing my medical history which is invaluable. In several more years, a few of my doctors will retire or either stop practicing because of all of the restrictions and stress which they face practicing. 
   It causes our stress levels to be off the charts from wondering if we will be able to get an appointment for our next script, if we will be physically able to travel to our physician, will the weather allow us to meet our appointment or will there be a snow storm or hurricane?  I have experienced both of these within the last year and had to get appointments changed with my physicians prior to giving out of medication. 
   Please act and not react by not imposing additional guidelines and regulations which have not been successful in reducing deaths although the number of prescription drug prescribed has declined in the last few years , provide funding for the treatment of these chronic pain diseases as well as for new medications specific for these conditions, educate medical schools and  physicians in the proper treatment and protocol of treating these, encourage new medical students to enter this field of medicine. Also it needs to be understood if patients who are prescribed opioids are monitored and have relationship with their physician there will not be cases of addiction in patients who experience this type of pain as our medications can never be diverted and vital for us to exist. 
   We need to provide proper education for our elected officials to understand the complexity  and challenge of living with these diseases and also provide more education for insurance officials to understand the need for providing coverage for these rare and painful diseases as well as educating the publicA

As a plan sponsor that provides Medicare Advantage (MA) coverage for nearly 100,000 enrollees through Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs), State Teacher Retirement System of Ohio urges you to carefully consider the implications of the changes to the MA-EGWP payment methodology proposed in the CY 2019 Advance Notice. 

Like many EGWPs, our plan utilizes a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), that affords us the opportunity to provide consistent benefits across the country to our retirees and enables us to fulfill the benefit promise made to our retirees. The EGWP PPO framework allows retirees, regardless of where they live, to have access to the same level of coverage during retirement they came to rely on while they were active employees.  A stable and predictable MA-EGWP payment policy will allows us to keep this important promise we made to our retirees years ago. 

As CMS seeks to finalize the proposals in the Advance Notice, we urge you take into account the dynamics of the employer retiree market and determine payments to this market accordingly. As part of the Advance Notice, CMS is formally proposing to fully transition in 2019 to using only individual market plan bids data to set payments for MA-EGWPs.  EGWPs like ours predominantly offer coverage through a PPO structure, while the individual MA market mostly uses an HMO structure.

Given the differences in the composition of the EGWP and individual MA markets, using a weighted average payment that mostly reflects HMO benefit structures to set payments for plans that mostly offer PPO benefit structures will likely cause unintentional coverage disruption for retirees and increase costs. While we are pleased that CMS is willing to consider alternative policies, the MA-EGWP payment methodology needs to use a benchmark that reflects the structure of MA-EGWP plans.  We strongly urge you to finalize a payment methodology that accurately sets payments for EGWP plans based on their benefit structure, be that PPO or HMO.  

We respectfully request the Agency respond to our questions as soon as possible and appreciate your consideration of our concerns.

1)Expecting all sponsors to implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at point-of-sale (POS) at the pharmacy (which can only be overridden by the sponsor) at 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME), with a 7 days supply allowance.

2)Implementing a supply limit for initial fills of prescription opioids (e.g., 7 days) for the treatment of acute pain with or without a daily dose maximum (e.g., 50 MME).

Much progress has been made in reducing opiod prescriptions to the extent that these regulations will create unnecessary work for the prescriber and create issues for patients as well.  Patients undergoing complex spine surgery, bilateral TKA and other extensive surgical procedure or treatment of complex orthopedic trauma and severe burns should not have clinical decsions interfered with at the POS.  Additionally, for so called ""legacy pain patients"" who are rapid metabolizers this interference with clinically sound treatment is inappropriate and unnecessary beyond a single intial consultation with a POS pharmacy.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0955","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","James Lakehomer-OR"

I have been diagnosed with Trigeminal and Occipital Neuralgia (diseases that are also known as ""The Suicide Disease"", because the pain is so severe, the majority of those who have it give up the fight within the first 3 years after being diagnosed. I'm sincerely thankful that I have not given up the battle). I also have  Degenerative Disc Diease resulting in a total of 6 herniated discs. I have undergone 2 (two) brain surgeries and 5 (five) surgeries on only 1 level of my Lumbar Spine, (L5-S1), with at least one more in mu Thoracic Spine and another in my Cervical Spine in the near future. I have tried anything and everything my Doctors have suggested to find a release from the constant vice that pain holds, not only my body, but also my mind and every aspect of my life. 
In addition to the surgeries, I am currently undergoing Physical Therapy. I have also undergone so many Epidural Steriod shots and other injections meant to relieve the pain on my nerves that I have lost count. I have taken multiple N-SAIDS, Cymbalta and Tordol, multiple creams, such as Lydocaine, a TENS unit that I used daily, as well a heating pad. I've tried seeing a Chiropractor, and I am currently seeing a Psychiatrist to deal with the Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder and PTSD that I also struggle with. I use other, non-medicinal ways to try to combat the pain, such as deep breathing exercises and biofeedback. These simply scratch the surface of all of the treatments I have tried and either failed, or have only been minimally effective. 

Currently, I have one Nerve Stimulator implanted in my body to help the pain that radiates down my right leg and wraps around my right ribs. I am also awaiting approval for a second Stimulator to be implanted to relieve some pain in the back of my head and neck on the right side. The neck pain radiates down my right arm at times. In short, my entire right side is in constant pain from illnesses that cannot be cured, only ""managed"". However, now I find that Medicare is seeking to limit my Doctor's ability to prescribe some of the medications that have provided me with enough relief to take a breath deeply and not cringe in pain. 
Of course, I am aware of the  ""Opiod Epidemic"" in our Nation. However, I feel that patients, such as myself, who take the ""Pain Medication Contract"" thst i signed witb my Doctor very seriously, I submit UA's on a regular basis, knowing that nothing like illicit drugs, alcohol, etc will be found. Lyrica has also been a Godsend to me. Before my Neurologist and I found it, I was curled up in the fetal position crying out for most of the day and night. Now, after so many years of searching for answers, my treatment plans is being altered, not by my Physician and myself, but by people who do not know me or my history. Chronic Pain Patients deserve to have a vokce as well, and.not be ""lumed in"" with heroin addicts. These new regulations are harming those.of us who simply cannot take more pain! The number of prescriptions written have decreasd while Overdose Deaths have INCREASED, which I take to mean those deaths are attributed to street drugs, not prescription medications. It is unjust and unfair to assume that responsible patients who are doing what they can to have a better quality of life, while living with many diseasees are considered the same as those who use drugs to get high. I beg of you to listen to the Chronic Pain Patients voices. We do not want to cry out in more pain!","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0995","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Mindy Conway, Fort Worth, TX"
"945","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"     I am a chronic pain patient who was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, chronic back pain and Irritable Bowel Syndrome 30yrs ago. I have a Medicare Advantage plan that follows all of Medicare's regulations. For the last 18yrs I have been on disability. 
     I have tried many different medications, including trycyclic antidepressants, anti-inflammatory, sleeping pills, gabapentin, Lyrica, steroids and anti-spasmodical before I started on opioids. Nothing helped relieve the pain until the opioid medication.  
     On top of all the medicines, I tried PT/OT, acupuncture, chiropractic care, epidural injections, rhyzotomies, aqua therapy, TENS, massages, acupressure, mega vitamins/minerals and several pain relief creams. 
     None of the above helped to relieve my constant pain which left me not being able to do anything physical. After I started taking Vicodin then switching to Duragesic patch, I was able to get out of bed, do some stretching, do some light housework and run a few errands. I continue in pain but it is mostly tolerable due to the opioid, I still have very painful days occasionally and unfortunately that will never change, making me dependent on the opioid but NOT an addict!!!!!  With time and age things will only get worse because my body won't be able to keep up with the changes from the pain. 
     If I am not able to get my pain medicine or my Medicare Advantage plan cuts the amount that I could get, it would be detrimental for me. I would take HUGE steps backwards in my health. I would be back to bed rest in such severe pain!!! I would go through withdrawals that would increase my risk for cardiac events, high blood pressure or stroke. If my doctor would be forced to taper down the pain medicine I wouldn't be able to function and the pain levels would be off the charts. Did anyone take that into consideration?
I am NOT a drug addict nor do I, or ever have gone drug seeking and I also do not indulge in alcohol. I have never ""run out""  of the opioid before I could refill it. I always use just one pharmacy for all of my medications. I truly tried everything possible before turning to pain and opioid management, it was a last resort. 
     I find it outrageous and very suspicious that the CDC guidelines were written by non-pain management physicians!  How could they even begin to write these guidelines without the specialists who dealt with pain patients day in and day out. Did these doctors benefit professionally or personally to write the guidelines? Did any of them research the chronic pain patient or actually talk to them?  Do they want more people buying street drugs because their doctor can't write a script due to the guidelines? The suicide rate will definitely increase because the pain will get to a point that you can't take any more. This will increase the demand for urgent care, ER visits and social service personnel.  Without pain relief patients will not be able to work which will increase unemployment and leads to more disability patients. 
     I am a chronic pain patient who depends on the Duragesic patch and my doctor, who knows all the complexities of my health care should be able to treat me without having Medicare/CDC guidelines. The extra red tape, paper work and phone calls for the doctors would be very time consuming. For the patient it is added stress, extra trips to the doctors and more co-pays. 
     The overall rate of overdoses have decreased in the last 5yrs. But has significantly increased with illicit drugs like heroin or fentanyl. This crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue!!!!!  I truly hope that the appropriate person or people will read this and actually do what is right.

In fact to quote him,""It is the worst case of fibromyalgia I've ever seen.""  In addition I have chronic fatigue syndrome and myofacial pain among other DEBILITATING conditions.  Now back to fibromyalgia... Let me break down the symptoms of fibromyalgia for those of you sitting in your glass houses making medication quantity requirements for the rest of us who have no quality of life sometimes WITH the drugs, let alone with a cut back to them or WITHOUT them entirely.

 These symptoms are in no particular order since they affect each of us with fibromyalgia differently and ONLY our doctors can prescribe the correct medications and in what dosages. PAIN affects every muscle, joint, and what feels like every cell in our bodies virtually from the tops of our heads to the bottom of our toes, DEPRESSION stems from fibromyalgia, along with INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, RASHES, SWELLING of the body (this could be anywhere or everywhere depending on what your fibro decides to do that day), FATIQUE, FEVERS, STIFFNESS IN THE JOINTS, MUSCLE SPASMS, INFLAMMATION, and the list continues.  I'm just so damn angry right now that these are only the FIRST ones that come to mind.  People, there is no ONE medicine for fibromyalgia.  There is nothing that comes to us wrapped in a pretty little bow that helps control all the demons fibromyalgia puts on us.  That INCLUDES LYRICA, SAVELLA, AND CYMBALTA.  All which I have tried and all are a joke.  There are many studies out there proving just that point.  I guess you people actually believe the commercials you see endorsing these ""miracle"" drugs.

Why don't you people in Medicare spend JUST ONE DAY in my body and then talk about cutbacks to medications.  Have you ever examined me?  Do you know what my body needs just to get out of bed in the morning? Then to STAY out of bed and not drop from PAIN, fatigue, and many of the other symptoms listed above before it is even 3:00pm?  

You have the NERVE, the sheer AUDACITY to come between my doctors (you know, the ones with the medical degrees that actually KNOW something about the random symptoms which fibromyalgia produces) and what is best for MY body?  Shame on you! 

I want you to make no mistake about this important point, however:  I AM IN FAVOR of shutting down ""pill mills.""  There are certainly many unscrupulous people out there looking for a way to take advantage of unscrupulous doctors willing to prescribe anything to anyone.  I am 100% against that.  Having said that, the government needs to go after THOSE people harder not make it harder for those of us who actually depend on them for some, ANY, quality of life.  The doctors in my state are already petrified of the FDA as it its... But I digress.

I have one question for you all.  Think long and hard before answering.  Would you rather live with a few possibly addictive PRESCRIPTION drugs from UNSCRUPULOUS doctors that simply MAY HELP you function as normally as possible each day with as little pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, swelling, etc. or would you rather be confined to your bed literally screaming and crying in pain, exhausted but can't sleep, wracked with intolerable muscle spasms, swelling in all limbs, joints stiff, and wishing you could disappear off the face of the earth due to something as simple as the LACK OF proper medication?  I've been to the place I've just described.  It's known to me as ""hell on earth.""  Trust me, it's somewhere NONE OF YOU ever want to go.

So before putting all these limits on the drugs we use and not mixing ""this"" with "" that,"" think HARD about my above question. I've had fibromyalgia for 13 yrs and my medications haven't killed me yet.  Fibromyalgia won't kill me either.  But I'll tell you this, without my meds, I wish it would.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0076","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Cynthia Garland-  FL"

I have osteoporosis which is collapsing my spine and I am fused from the waist up which failed, I have fibromyalgia, I have periostitis which makes my bones hurt, and lastely I have chronic piriformis inflamation that adds to the overall unrelenting horrific pain that feels like it I am dying but I keep waking up everyday. My blood pressure gets dangerously high without pain medications that give some relief and make my life bearable. I can dress myself, make meals, and take the dog for a walk. Without medications I would definately end my life. I tried living without opiods mightily. I did not want to be considered an addict or that I was a failure and somehow this was my fault. I eat all organic, do physical therapy, see a therapist, and follow my doctors instruction faithfully in hopes I can get relief. I recieve my medications from an excellent pain clinic that cares and has saved my life. When I came to them I was on deaths door. I weighed 130 lbs at 6ft tall, had tried to end my life from unrelenting bed ridden pain, and had pretty much given up on living. I was put on a variety of medications that have finally improved my quality of life to wear I can go to church, do my hair, and go to a movie. I do not think it is right that the government gets to decide what dose of pain medication I need or that I cannot get them because of people who are addicts. I can honestly say that I do not get high of my medication nor do I take more medication than agreed with by my doctor. My doctors who go to college for years and are in dealing with intractable pain should decide with me on how to proceed to help me have some quality of life. Please have a sense of humanity for those who truly suffer through no fault of there own. With my levels of pain, opiods saved my life. Without opiods I would surely die a slow painful death.

proposals for use of opiates  as they relate to those drugs  used  in HPM care. I think some limits should be in place for 
outpatient practice, but there MUST be ""carve-outs"" or exceptions for Hospice and Palliative care.

I have many categories of patients who need ongoing levels of opiates, and combinations with antidepressants , seizure 
meds, and  benzodiazepines. They are monitored between 1 and 3 times weekly. We are treating high level pain syndromes 
such as  peripheral vascular insufficiency pain, angina, bone mets , neuropathies, and  invasive tumors of all sorts that have 
no other treatment options. 
It is absurd to send these patients who are likely homebound to a pharmacy weekly. We deliver meds to many people.

I am in regular communication with other doctors  and collaborate with my colleagues as to appropriate drug usage. Our 
population is very different from the ambulatory office patients I saw for 30 years in an office. Even there, we at times we
 needed access to high level opiates, and monitored their use.

The current opioid hysteria is not new. A century or more ago, we had opium dens.  President Reagan and his advisor Mr.
 Bennett again ramped up the ""war on drugs "" in the late 20th century. We will NEVER be able to fully curtail illicit drug use.
I know there are ""bad apples"" in the doctor world, and prescription mills, but there are already rules and safeguards in place 
for those. Surely,  I and my patients should not pay a terrible price for others' irresponsibility. 

My patients are suffering severe pain AS THEY DIE. They do not need someone on high dictating that they must suffer more.
If you want my job, please come and take over and try to do better for them. In the meantime, do not saddle doctors with
micromanagement rules that will NOT improve care.

"950","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a 68 year old woman, who has multiple pain conditions (viz., fibromyalgia, degenerative disk disease, hemiplegic migraine, abscessed teeth, osteoarthritis, sciatica, piriformis syndrome, CPPD, and myofascial pain syndrome). I am also a Medicare/Medicaid patient. My doctor has prescribed a low dose of Percocet for me over the past 40 years, or so (I have been in pain since the age of 30, or so, with regular flareups. It began with a case of tortocollis... out of the blue. No one knows what caused that.) Since then-- between muscular, joint and headache pain-- I have almost always been in some level of pain-- often severe-- and have often been prescribed opoids, but never a huge amount. My doctor had no problem with what he was prescribing me-- until the government got involved. Now, he is scared, and has told all his patients that he will no longer prescribe painkillers. Those of us who are used to such meds (not addicted, but pain-dependent), are at a loss-- or at least, I am. I refuse to label myself either a psych patient or an addict. I have never abused a prescription. I have taken such meds as Gabapentin, Lyrica, etc., but cannot tolerate the side effects (nor do they help much with pain). I can no longer tolerate Gabapentin, as I develop an akasthenic reaction to it. Nor can I take Lyrica-- I literally cannot think on it. I have also tried Celebrex, but couldn't remember who I was, after taking one. I tried a low dose of Doxepin, but I cannot think straight on it (10 mg., I can tolerate: that helps with sleep, but I cannot tolerate anything more; I just gain weight and act dopey). I cannot tolerate other antidepressants at all. I also cannot take Ibuprofen, as I have stomach and digestive issues. I may be allergic to aspirin (developed a rash). Basically, the only drug that works (other than low dose of Fioricet for migraines), is a low dose of Percocet --2-3 per day). I always count up my acetaminophen mg., and have never taken over 1500 mg. per day (usually more like 1000 mg.)

If I have a migraine, arthritis and fibro attack all at the same time, I can at least think with low doses of these acetaminophen compound drugs-- enough for me to write, do housework, go to choir, etc. Otherwise, I'd be totally bed-ridden (and I cannot afford a caregiver-- nor can I obtain other state aid, as I'm not in a wheelchair). 

I think that this hysteria over ""opioid addiction"" is targeting the wrong set of people! I have read that the addicts who shoot -up and abuse are still obtaining their drugs (from abroad), and THAT is what is causing the ""overdoses"" (mostly re: heroin and fentanyl mixed together). I have read that LESS than one percent of pain patients are true addicts, ie. that they abuse their scripts. Most doctors are very careful about these prescriptions, but at least have some knowledge of what they are doing. I doubt that most of the people making such laws and interfering with doctor/patient relationships really understand what is happening, here, nor know what chronic pain feels like. I think that curtailing opioids will benefit pharmaceutical companies, yes; but many of us cannot tolerate these medications. If anyone is causing bad medicine and overdosing, it is those who determine these policies, but who possess little medical/chronic pain education. 

In addition, I don't think that using either certain psychotherapies or with Eastern spiritual modalities (though perhaps slightly helpful-- whether by placebo or via brain-washing) is a solution, as it may interfere with some of Judaic- Christian beliefs. I myself have obtained a conditional dispensation to use acupuncture (on a sliding scale), but cannot say that I adhere to its belief system. But since that's all that may be left, for some of us, I may try it. However, I believe that this legislation is also interfering both with doctor/ patient relationships, and also, with separation of Church and State.

"951","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As a disabled chronic pain patient, I strongly oppose the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' plan to accept policies from the recent CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. I implore you to take action so that this mandate does not become a reality for the 100 million Americans who suffer with chronic pain, including many on Medicare.The CDC guideline is simply a voluntary guide intended for primary care physicians only. The CMS guideline as written gives no margin or credence to pain management doctors who already have strict opioid policies, as well as an established ongoing relationship with their patients.

Your currently drafted policy makes the guidelines mandatory for all doctors, patients and pharmacists, and imposes a ceiling on the highest dose of opioids that can be prescribed. This gives physicians no discretion in determining what is right for their patients. That was never the CDC's intent.

In January 2018 public hearings before the FDA Opioid Policy Steering Committee, the American Academy of Pain Management recommended against hard limits on opioid analgesics.  Your current policy also fails to consider a patients metabolism, and  unique body chemistry.  A prescription dosage that is proper for one patient simply is not suitable for another.  This dosage is best to be determined by a patient's physician, not a Medicare representative.   Being turned away at a pharmacy will result in unplanned withdrawals and tapering  of medication and an undue hardship  on our community emergency rooms,

At 37 years old, I am permanently disabled with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, cervical radiculopathy, as well as many other pain conditions for which there is no cure. Disability became a reality for me at the young age of 29 when many other young people's lives are just beginning.  At the young age of 37, I sometimes feel my life is over. If not for pain control from opioid medication, it surely would become a reality.  I am a patient who treats with my physician regularly and attends all scheduled appointments.  Taking opioid medications was not my first course of treatment, it was my last.  I have tried many treatments over my 13 year pain journey, including physical therapy, epidurals, facet joint injections, chiropractor treatments, and TENS units.

I never asked to be overcome with this much pain from so many ""invisible illnesses."" As a prior student at Villanova University, I was able to live an active daily life, both socially and educationally.  I was working on a Master's Degree and beginning a teaching career when my life was halted by chronic pain. I am challenged daily to accept the reduced quality of life for myself and, in turn, for my family. Fortunately, my empathetic pain doctor will prescribe me enough medication so that I am functioning. If my current regimen were to be lowered to the amount set forth in this guideline, I would not be able to fully care for myself, perhaps be bedridden, and be left with a dramatically diminished quality of life.

This mandate actually takes away my right to a quality of life that I deserve. The burden of being struck with legitimate pain conditions should not equate to the loss of a right to live life with dignity, just as any other patient with any other chronic illness.  According to the proposed guidelines , only those with cancer are those entitled to proper pain treatment.  I can assure you, spending many hours and weeks in doctors offices , that chronic pain is real regardless of the diagnosis or the condition.  Many doctors are now frightened of prescribing pain medication for fear the CDC, DEA or FDA would sanction their license, when they simply want to fulfill their oath of ""do no harm."" And let's be clear, not prescribing pain medication to a patient who is suffering, is doing harm! 

Taking pain medication away from a pain patient will not stop the criminals, drug cartels or addicts. Those issues are worlds away. Pain patients are not addicts or looking for a ""high."" They depend on their medication just as a diabetic depends on insulin for life quality.

Mended Hearts wishes to offer our comments on the Part D provisions of the proposed draft Call Letter titled, ""Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter,"" and particularly the proposal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit Part D Plans (PDPs) to substitute dietary supplements for prescription drugs in the Medicare Prescription benefit.  As a leading association representing heart patients across the lifespan, we are deeply troubled by the Agency's proposal and urge CMS to withdraw any reference to dietary supplements from the Call Letter when it is finalized. 

Mended Hearts is the largest peer to peer support network for cardiovascular patients in the world. We represent 20,000 members and provide support for over 200,000 patients every year. Our organization is located within 300 local communities across the country serving over 460 hospitals. Many of our patients rely on Medicare for their health care needs and we assert that the voice of the patient be protected in discussions, such as this determination presented. 
The Draft Call Letter (Part II), page 197, proposes to allow PDPs: ""to include additional OTC products such as dietary supplements and cough medicines, without the requirement that either product offset the use of a Part D drug.""  We object to this proposal, and urge CMS to withdraw it from the final Call Letter.  As explained below, dietary supplements are not equivalent to, and cannot be substituted for, prescription drugs; and they cannot be used to treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate disease.  Instead, dietary supplements are ""food""  not subject to any FDA approval and they have no place in the Part D Prescription Drug benefit.  

Mended Hearts believes that protecting the patient from harm should be first and foremost at the top of all discussions. Making informed decisions are vital to our patients and this proposed rule change would open patients to a false sense of security when looking towards dietary supplements in their total health care equation. The current regulations regarding dietary supplements do not provide consumers or health care providers with sufficient information on safety and efficacy to make informed decisions about the use of such supplements. And therefore, Mended Hearts is against such a policy change.

 Please review the article at the following URL at Practical Pain Management .com.

https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/sudden-unexpected-death-chronic-pain-patients

 This is an extensive, scholarly article written by Forest Tennant, MD, DrPH, dealing with the subject of sudden, unexpected deaths in chronic/intractable pain patients due to an absence of access to adequate opioid pain medication. Opioids are - unfortunately - for many people the only treatment that provides any relief from what is literally intolerable, crippling and often times - yes - killing pain.

 I am one of these people and have spent the last 10 years suffering from the incurable neurological condition RSD/CRPS. Over the last 10 years I have been subjected to so many different medical procedures, medications and therapies that it would take a very long time to list them all, and out of all of them the only thing that has ever provided me any relief from what is absolutely crippling incapacitating pain are opioids. Medication which I am now denied and expect that as now all I can do is lay in bed getting weaker and sicker every day as I am literally stripped of what little vitality I have left by unspeakable pain that I am going to die relatively soon, from either a heart attack, a stroke or circulatory seizure due to the fact that the human body can only tolerate so much pain before it just quits.

 This is not hyperbole. This is not melodrama. This is not hysteria. This is not a case of the vapors. This is cold hard medical fact as detailed in the above referenced article.

 Denying opioid medication to persons such as myself who suffer from incurable medical conditions that cause intractable, crippling and unspeakable pain is tantamount to murder. By withholding medication that people rely on for their lives you are literally killing them.

 How does it feel to be a murderer?

"964","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a retired Health Care Professional and a chronic pain patient who is on Medicare. I implore you not to restrict good doctors who are helping their patients function at all with the use of opioids.  I ran a support group for chronic pain patients, and scheduled physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, pain specialists, psychiatrists and psychologists, naturopaths, pharmacists, massage therapists . . . .literally anyone who might be able to help these people and me deal with daily pain. Many were able to lower their doses of opioids, but many just couldn't.  I had several who told me they would rather die than have a really low quality of life.  I know that feeling.  Lying in bed in such pain that you are sick to your stomach and have to crawl back and forth to the bathroom is definitely not quality living. At one point, I even considered ending my life, but my faith and my family and doctor worked through it with me. With a small amount of medication (yes, opioids), I can manage to at least attend some family functions and see my grandchildren who live quite a distance from me.  It is very difficult for me to travel without overwhelming pain. There are many disease states that are so painful, there is no option but opioids, if you take them away, what can they do? I know there are many people who are addicted and they need help to wean off the drugs or be prosecuted. But chronic pain patients are not the ones who should suffer because some physicians have no scruples or some people steal medication from others, or sell street drugs.  We already have laws against that - how well are they enforced?  Heroin, fentanyl in horse doses, meth, and the other street drugs need to become unavailable.  These are not the medications the majority of chronic pain patients use.  In fact, unless they have been driven to obtain them ""illegally"" because their physicians couldn't or wouldn't (for fear of DEA consequences), most chronic pain patients take their opioids as prescribed by their physicians.  Physicians I know are all about trying to reduce the amount they take, without decreasing their quality of life, and when they want more medicine each month, there is a big chance in the prescription process because it is a sign of abuse. Until there is more research and more options for pain management drugs, please don't hurt those who literally have tried everything, but nothing works except opioids.  I'm all for requiring patients to see their physicians on a frequent basis to evaluated by practical guidelines, established by specialists who deal with pain all the time.  But I am totally against a knee jerk reaction to what I believe is an overexaggerated problem.  I don't think Heroin, etc. drugs should be included in the statistics that are thrown at us.  I am NOT saying that we don't have a nationwide problem, I do believe that is the case, and something needs to be done about it.  But surely there are more human ways to tackle this problem than ridiculously strict, unmanageable limitations.  Not one TV station has looked at the ramifications of this on the legitimately diagnosed chronic pain patient. It's too sad, and isn't shocking enough or newsworthy.  Please listen to those of us who need you to consider our plight before enforcing rules that may cause some of us to kill ourselves.  I know of some veterans who took their own lives because the VA wouldn't prescribe opioids, and they just couldn't handle to pain anymore.  Is that the right way to treat the men and women who risked their lives for us?

"965","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"This is a second comment to the docket,  following on and expanding my input of a few days ago on behalf of the Alliance for the Treatment of Intractable Pain and millions of chronic and intractable pain patients who will be deeply harmed by the proposed CMS regulation changes.  

I challenge HHS/CMS to read and embrace the attached article, about to hit news stands across the US, written by Jacob Sullum, Senior Editor of *Reason Magazine*.  ""America's War on Pain Pills Is Killing Addicts and Leaving Patients in Agony""

This article demonstrates beyond any reasonable contradiction that America's opioid ""crisis"" is almost entirely unrelated to medically managed prescription of opioid analgesics by doctors to pain patients. This work and the references quoted in it utterly discredit the dominant official narrative concerning the sources of addiction in America.  

The draconian and unsupported regulations which CMS seeks to impose in mandatory safety audits and limitation of opioid dosing will reliably damage many more than the 1.6 million patients now estimated to be prescribed more than 90 MMED.  The regulations will also damage and kill many more people with addiction, as well. 

Two other sources should also enter the official record in opposition to the proposed CMS changes.  

Dr Sally Satel, an addiction psychiatrist, has published ""The Myth of What's Driving the Opioid Crisis (Doctor-prescribed painkillers are not the biggest threat).""  See https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/21/the-myth-of-the-roots-of-the-opioid-crisis-217034 .  Her points parallel and reinforce those of Jacob Sullum.

Finally, I have also published recently in these issues, with Stephen Schatman,MD,  ""Do Alternatives to Opioids Really Exist?""  See https://morningconsult.com/opinions/do-alternatives-to-opioids-really-exist/ .  With Dr Schatman, I point out that the quality of medical literature for non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical alternatives in treatment of chronic pain is so abysmal that we really do not know whether such alternatives provide any benefit beyond placebo effect.  We also address the failure of medical demographics to support the silly notion that over-prescribing to pain patients could have caused the explosion of addicts now so near and dear to politician hearts.  

Thus pain patients offer CMS this message:  CEASE HALT AND DESIST!  Retract your proposal and relinquish the outright STUPID notion that restriction of opioid therapy to pain patients can impact the drug crisis at all.  It cannot.  All that you will succeed in doing is harming more people than the CDC opioid prescription guidelines already have.

"966","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a primary care physician. Many of my patients are in subgroups who would be unduly affected by these proposed new policies, which are neither evidence-based nor compassionate:

1. Patients with cancer, some of whom have incurable cancer;
2. Patients with chronic pain, much of which is intractable and unsusceptible to treatments besides opiates;
3. Patients with sickle-cell disease. many of whom also have chronic pain, due to osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis or other causes, and who suffer from frequent vaso-occlusive crises.

This policy was formulated with full knowledge of the recent guidelines promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control. I review very briefly for the benefit of CMS: these guidelines do *not* mandate that opiates *not* be used. (These guidelines do not even address patients with cancer. Thus the CMS policy is from the get-go stricter than the scientific evidence for all patients with cancer.) Rather, the clinician and the patient are meant to discuss the use of opiates on the basis of a risk/benefit balance. 

CMS is proposing a policy based on fantasy: that reducing the prescription of opiates by fiat will somehow reduce the number of overdose deaths.  As Stefan Kertesz and other experts have demonstrated, this is not supported by evidence. It is very likely that patients now on opiates, to be denied them by this misguided policy, will turn to illegal opiates. I tremble for the fate of my patients with sickle cell disease, African Americans, who depend on opiates. If CMS denies them these medications, will they somehow magically not need them, or will they be at the mercy of our punitive legal system? This policy bids fair to extend and strengthen the disparities afflicting African Americans (who bear the brunt of sickle cell disease and suffer much chronic pain) well into this century.

I think not just of policies but of my individual patients. My patients with pain, for whom opiates are sometimes the only choice (as imperfect as they are), will have to jump through even more hoops. Each hoop is a judgment that their illness is not worth our care. Each hoop is a chance for them to leave our care and find medication from a dangerous unregulated source. Each hoop means fewer people helped.

CMS employees - is this why you are working at HHS? Is this what our health system is meant to do?

I hope to work for at least 8 more years.  The CDC guidelines, if not rewritten will ensure that doesn't happen.

Over a period of ten years, I have seen: Neurologists, Chiropractors, Osteopath, Oncologist, Homeopath, Medical Intuitive, Acupuncturist, Healing Touch practitioners, Alexander Technique practioner, Medical Massage Therapist, Hypnotist, Psychologist, Psychiatrist, Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Rheumatologist and Integrative Medicine Practioners.

I tried Biofeedback, Yoga, Relaxation Techniques, Trigger Point Injections, Nerve Blocks, Epidural Spinal Injections, supplements, Vitamins, Essential Oils, Guaifenesin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor, Paxil, Prozac, Pristiq, Cymbalta, Lyrica, Savella, Wellbutrin, Trazadone, Gabapentin, Dilantin, Depakote, Tegretol, Topamax, Ability, Seroquil, NSAIDS, steroids (oral and I.V.), Tianjin, Skelaxin and Ritalin.  I have undergone Chemotherapy and Rituxin therapy.

After ten years of trial and error, I found a regimen that allows me to work, take care of myself, my home and rescue animals and lead a normal life.  It was not a snap decision to begin opioid drug therapy.  I tried every alternative therapy and therapist available.

I am a compliant patient.  I go to a pain management clinic, get prescriptions from one doctor and go to one pharmacy.  I signed a contract agreeing to random drug screenings and pill counts, have never asked for an early refill or sold or given my medication away.

The CDC Guidelines were written outside the rules by those with a strong anti-opioid bias, without input from Pain Management Specialists or Patients.  The guidelines will enforce a 'one size fits all' dosage, without regard for the way each person metabolizes medications, their age, size or medical condition.

This coerced tapering will put many patients at a sub-therapeutic dosage, including me.  I won't be able to continue to work, take care of myself, our animals or our home.  I won't be able to travel to see our adult children or enjoy any form of social activities.  When quantity of life exceeds quality of life; that's really not life at all.

Opioid prescriptions are at a ten year low, however, opioid overdose deaths have continued to rise.  The 'opioid crisis' is not due to compliant chronic, intractable pain patients and their doctors, but rather to illegal Heroin, Fentanyl, and Cocaine.  The media lists the number of opioid deaths for any given time period, and they continue to say that prescription pain medication causes the majority of opioid deaths; this just is not the case.  Americans are dying from illegal drugs; if the CDC Guidelines aren't rewritten, many more will die.  Some chronic pain sufferers will turn to street drugs for pain relief, others will take their own lives rather than face the agony of what their lives will be without the proper medication at a therapeutic dose; when all that awaits them is death anyway.

Please, DON'T ruin the lives of millions of Americans just to show that SOMETHING is being done about the opioid crisis (because it's the wrong THING and the wrong opioid and only time will show the devastating effects) or to further the interests of a select group of people.  Please, DO stop the illegal drugs coming into the country, prosecute those who sell them, find out why those who take them choose to do so and institute programs to help them.

"971","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Absolutely DO NOT implement the proposed new rules regarding opioids.   Opioids have been proven safe &effective treatment for intractable pain-severe pain that never stops, 24-7. They allow people to work, some to have quality of life, &some to barely function, but remain independent (not in a convalescent home).  Putting your rules into affect will cause many people (1.6 million just in your network alone) to no longer work or require convalescent care, adding a huge burden to the disability system.  There are some that won't be able to handle the pain &will commit suicide. There have been numerous studies recently showing how the opioid addiction increases are from street drugs brought in from out of country-NOT from prescribing. Look at those studies. Here are 2: the British Medical Journal & JAMA Internal Medicine. You have access to them - if I, as a lay person can find them, then you certainly can so either you are ignoring them or you are severely - years - behind the times.  During Your public hearings last year, other medical agencies/people AND the American Academy of Pain Management ""recommended against hard limits on opioid analgesics."" LISTEN. Know your place. By putting medicine back in the hands of MEDICINE (doctors).  You are not doctors, you have not been to medical school. What would happen if ""I"" decided what medicine &how much another person needed? Wouldn't that be considered strange/immoral/maybe even illegal? That is what you are doing & it's deplorable. You are the leaders, you set the precedence. That means your decisions carry incredible responsibility. Do you want to be responsible for millions of potential suicides due to under treatment? Responsible for millions of people not able to work anymore due to you removing their medical treatment? Responsible for putting millions of people in convalescent homes, thereby costing you & other insurances immense amount of money? Be Responsible. Be cognizant. Be aware. Be compassionate. The proposed guidelines are a chaotic response to hysteria, and not based in facts. Renewing a prescription every 7 days? Do you have ANY idea how hard that is for a sick person to get to their doctor & pharmacy AT ALL? Once per month is hard enough for truly sick people. Once a week would be prohibitive for millions - just to follow some Ridiculous rule? If that is your intent - that means you are choosing to put all of those people either in convalescent homes, prevent them from working, or allow them to die from lack of adequate medical treatment. Do you profit from that? I can't figure out why you want to do that. Why have you waged a war on people that are too sick to have a voice? It's cruelty as the most basic level. Kick a person while they are down. Is this your intent?It is definitely NOT based in fact. CMS is acting like there is a problem to solve. Yet there is none. It's hysteria, not facts, that are creating this ""problem"". The proposed regulations will CREATE worse problems that right now do not exist. You are trying to ""fix"" something that isn't broken.I was an extremely active outdoors woman & ambitious worker with plans to become an engineer/chemist or both. &then received a medical injury, called Adhesive Arachnoiditis (AA) with severe inflammation of my Cauda Equina.  The AA causes my spinal cord to swell which is Extremely painful because it has nowhere to ""expand"", & caused the nerves to scar together & stick to the walls of the spinal cord. The nerves transmit severe 24-7 pain (called intractable pain) Over the pain scale of 1-10. It took me from a highly functional professional person to Nothing.  It is incurable and progressive. I tried Every treatment I could find to avoid being on opioids - but Nothing worked. I need lifelong opioid therapy. I am in the 80% of people that have the genetic defect that means I need a higher dose than the ""normal"" 20% of people. THIS MUST be taken into account which requires tests & doctors to determine. Opioids literally saved my life. I am still disabled, but Without opioid therapy at the level I am on, I would be deceased or in a convalescent center.I did not ask for this life. Every human being needs individualized health care.  One size does Not fit all. Not for thyriod disease, heart disease, cancer, etc. So why the ""one size fits all"" for pain patients? It makes no sense. That's why doctors are specially trained to give each person individualized medical treatment. That's THEIR purpose.  Let them do their jobs.  Let US have medical treatment. I am asking you to find the moral fiber of your being - do not put these rules into place.  They will cause incalculable suffering and burden to the already overloaded medical system.  Please put medicine back in medicine.  Put it back in the hands of the people trained to do so - the doctors.  Do NOT implement these rules.

"977","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"These changes to medicare are absolutely barbaric. They say history never repeats itself, but it does rhyme. That couldn't be more true. Medicine is truly going back to the Dark Ages thanks to bloated bureaucratic agencies obsessed with their ability to play god and think they know what's best for patients. Forget the doctors that slave away for years studying at medical school and becoming doctors, these bureaucrats with degrees in political science, human resources, and management know everything. Maybe I should ask the idiots proposing these guidelines feels just as comfortable performing heart and brain surgery too.

Doctors know what is best for their patients. If they write scripts for opioids over 90 MME, it is probably because they need it. I have extreme pain from a rare disease and take 460 MME every day. I've been on this dose for well over 7 years after failing treatment with every NSAID, anticonvulsant and antidepressant available. I also failed acupuncture, injections, surgeries. I effectively failed every treatment for one reason or another except opioids. They are the only treatment that worked for me and given my size,age, gender, and genetics, I need the dose I take. It takes my pain from a 10 to a 1 and I have no side effects and can still work fine.These barbaric limits would be absolutely devastating to me. I already have to do appeals every year, which I win because my medical records justify my treatment. I'm terrified that these new guideline will destroy my life. The government always takes more than they say and makes rarely repeals bad legislation/policies. Who knows what all the unintended consequences of these changes will be? The predictable ones are horrific enough as it is. I still can't figure out why the government is fine with sacrificing functional chronic pain patients for dysfunctional drug addicts with relapse rates through the roof. This doesn't even make sense from a societal cost/benefit analysis.

Also, the CDC guidelines are a farce, they were drafted in the middle of the night by zealous anti-opioid groups with a personal vendetta against these medications. Many of these groups are made up of addiction doctors that own detox facilities and family members of overdose victims. These groups are not objective in any way and the doctors that are involved with them stand to make large sums of money if they convince the government and insurance companies that doses greater than 90MME are ""dangerous and unncessary."" If dosages over 90MME are effectively banned via non-coverage, what happens to people like me? We can't suddenly stop or reduce our medications overnight, which means we will likely end up in some type of detox program. The CDC did not seek input on their guidelines from chronic pain patient, chronic pain patient advocates, or pain management doctors that use opioids to treat appropriate patients.Does that sound like an objective guideline crafted by professionals in their field? 

Finally, the proposed changes state that the new limits/rules won't apply to cancer patients.There is no difference between cancer pain and non-cancer pain. Pain is pain and is modulated by the same nervous system we all have. In fact, many conditions are more painful than cancer, yet the government and insurance companies continue the charade that there is somehow a difference between the two. 

I would like to point out that the CDC guidelines are not meant for pain management doctors either. The CDC guidelines state that they are only recommendations and only for primary care physicians. So, why is medicare proposing to use them on everyone, including patients being treated and receiving prescriptions from a pain management doctor?

If you take a one-size-fits-all approach to the opioid crisis then you will be doing irreparable harm to countless legitimate chronic pain patients. My wife suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy. She tried every option before taking opioid medications and only opioid medications allowed her the freedom to begin to live a life. Unless you have dealt with a loved one in intractable pain you cannot know how difficult of a situation it is to see someone you love in truly agonizing pain. She lives in fear of her dose being cut back (against her doctor's better judgment). If that happens I fear that she would become one of the many chronic pain patients who have killed themselves because they could not stand the pain or get adequate pain management.

Opioids are the strongest pain-killing drugs known to humankind. While they have the potential for abuse, they also can be taken responsibly. Research on addition demonstrates that if they are just being taken at a dose that limits pain without inducing a high the likelihood of addiction is exceedingly remote. In addition, a chronic pain patient is likely to develop tolerance and need to raise the dose of medication at some point, so you cannot set an arbitrary dose as the amount that you believe is necessary. That should be a decision made by the doctor and doctors should be free to use their best judgment without worry of repercussions.

"979","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic, intractable pain patient with 4 autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.  I have been a Medicare patient since 2010.  I rely upon opioid medications to manage my incurable pain, allow for increased function, and remain somewhat productive.

I have stayed on the same dosage for the past 10 years without any increase.  Research does support the use of opioids for chronic pain disorders, and it is a fact that most intractable pain patients can use opioids long-term without becoming addicts. Opioid medications are a valuable addition to other therapies in my toolbox in keeping the pain under control. Do not take them away from those of us who are able to take them and benefit from them. Don't rely on myths, ignorance and misinformation by putting any limitations on the amount or length of time I can take these medications. It is not a decision that should be made by any government agency, only between the doctor and patient.

My health has suffered tremendously since the CDC Guidelines were issued and the government decided it knows more about pain management than doctors do.
If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day, this will give insurance companies and pharmacies another excuse to stop paying for my necessary prescriptions and/or dispensing them at all. 
Not only are these proposed regulations not supported by any reliable science, if they are enacted, these policies most likely could force even more doctors away from treating pain, more patients onto Disability, more patients onto Medicaid, create more demand for emergency room services, increase the rate of expensive procedures, and increase the rate of suicides, of which there are too many already. Yet our government does not seem to care.

All government agencies must stop making medical decisions about prescription opioid medications without representation from both Pain Management Specialists and chronic, intractable pain patients that depend on these medications to live as comfortably as possible.  Do not punish us just because other members of our society abuse our medications!

Limiting medications for the people in cronic pain is not going fix the opoid episode. The other comment I have heard from he chronically Ill, is if they take their meds they will have to buy heroin or find pain meds on the street. So you in actuality will be making the opoid crisis worse, just heroin worse. Going after the people who live in chronic pain is not going to help. It is beyond ignorant to think this is a fix. You are going to punish the people who do everything they are supposed to do.

I am a chronic pain patient and suffer daily, yet still do my very best to be a productive member of society. I have active children and I never miss anything they are involved in. I also serve as a School Board member in a very successful school district. I'm a Type 1 diabetic since 10 yrs old and worked for 23 yrs in a teaching hospital as a Respiratory Therapist. I normally worked in our Level 1 Trauma Center and ER. Very strenuous job that I loved. I have also been having orthopedic surgeries since the age of 24 the first being on my hip. I also suffer from Osteoarthritis, due to a very active lifestyle. I do not suffer from major side effects from uncontrolled diabetes. Just the opposite. I suffer from loss of symptoms of hypoglycemia which has led to innumerable seizures. First hip surgery at 24 for Cam/pincer lesion which didn't even have a diagnosis in 1994 and required 2 surgeries. After recovering from surgery and returning to work I began having problems with my hands and so now I have a connective tissue disorder which causes freezing of all my joints. I have had 16 hand surgeries, 12 shoulder surgeries and 9 hip surgeries. These include both sides of my body. You can do the math on the total and my joints and hands are just something I accept but cannot function without my pain management and opioid treatment. I've also been diagnosed with Dupuytren Contractures, and after losing conscious from a low blood sugar shattered my already limited range of motion in one of my shoulders. I need two surgeries to correct this but dread the thought of another much less 2. With weather changes and barometric changes not to mention cold weather I have days I cannot function without my meds. As a Type 1 diabetic with a medical degree, following instructions on medication doses is not a problem. If it were I would already be dead or kicked out of a pain management clinic. I've never failed any urine drug screen nor been wrong on my pill count. I follow the strict guidelines and wouldn't wish this on anyone. My family is supportive however, fearful if this is taken away. I can't and they can't imagine how I will be able to live. If a pain patient doesn't follow the guidelines the doctor will no longer see them, so why do they need the government or insurance companies to treat patients when they went to school for years to learn and obtain a license to treat patients. This is something called, ""out of your scope of practice""! I cannot sit back and not state how incredibly debilitating pain can be, and I'm allergic as in anaphylaxis to aspirin & NSAIDS. I will no longer want to live if I must endure the pain under your guidelines. Our poor veterans who fought for our freedoms, are being given nothing to help with their pain and we see an alarming amount of suicides from our veterans. How can you do this? I didn't ask or want any of this, I wish I could be normal but I'm not and haven't been since early childhood. I pray and pray that you would look at the number of celebrity deaths from overdosing. Celebrities and those with OAD will still break the law and get what they want, NOT NEED, regardless. I'm begging you not to torment our lives any more than they are already tormented, with diseases and pain that we wish everyday we did not have. I see less than 1% of pain management patients or post operatives abuse. The studies just don't show evidence based conclusions. I can't begin to fathom how people like myself can continue to live if you restrict this. Every patient is different and if you had a medical degree you would know, treat the patient, not the disease. I can assure you we are watching and will note how our Congress men & women vote and with over a million pain patients we can make a difference in many elections. I'm just asking you to ask yourself, how do I know how much medicine a person with a reconstructive hip, shoulder or knee might need? Have you had this procedure? Do you have this disease and would you wish a completely miserable and non functioning life on anyone? Much less the inability to live or even want to? What about your family members that you love? I think not. Please do not be in humane, please don't take any more of my life away than already has been. Despite all I've been through I remain thankful to be here and I'm thankful I have this instead of someone else. I'm thankful for everyday I'm given, I know someone always has it worse than me. So I'm going to remain thankful to you for doing your job until you make my life unbearable to live any longer. Then I'll work as hard as I can to make changes for those who are unfortunate to suffer after me. The epidemic hysteria is caused by celebrities, drug addicts and criminals NOT those of us suffering.

I am a chronic pain sufferers since Dec. 1994. I have failed back syndrome, stenosis, degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis. I have been dependent on my opioid medicine to function as near to a normal person as possible. I have been through 25 surgeries and I can't imagine how hard the recovery would have been without my medicine. Without the ability to obtain these medicines even on a reduced amount will lead to a loss of daily activities, inability to do the simplest of tasks and will negatively impact my quality of life.

The saddest part of this is I have yet to read any reliable science to support the implementation of the new laws. 
It's hard enough now to find pain doctors this will make it worse. Without the medicine folks will have to leave work and hope they qualify for disability. Folks will swamp to ER's for pain relief or be forced to have ineffective surgeries at a great cost to the patient and the insurance company. No one wants surgery but it may well be the only alternative. As you are aware of chronic pain leads to suicides because it's the only way to end the pain.

"993","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am appalled at the proposed items I read in the adjoining documents concerning the denial or limitation of opioid pain medicine to patients. This is wrong. I am not a criminal. I've done nothing wrong. And yet with the removal or limitation of my daily opioid pain medicine & my opioid break-thru pain medicine I will be punished by the state, my only crime being sick. I have Idiopathic Small Fiber Polyneuropathy, Occipital & Trigeminal Neuralgia, Sciatica, Autonomic Neuropathy, Herniated Discs, the list goes on for quite a while. I implore you to look these diseases/conditions up. They are known to be some of the most painful things the human body can experience. Like most with intractable pain, I look at my medicine like a tool/helper/requirement for an attempt at a decent daily life; like I look to a good night's sleep, my stretches, eating well, etc. I take many forms of medicine; 17 in total including OTC's. Each is a valuable part of how I am able to continue to even try to function on a semi-regular basis. I consider my pain medicine an extraordinarily valuable part of that plan to try to make the day slightly bearable. You are simply making a mistake when you think you know how to treat me and my pain far better than my Pain Management Physician does. I am one of the patients who does receive a higher than normal dose of pain medicine and does not have Cancer or is in Hospice. We exist. We are real. To say I don't matter or I am not to be afforded the same level of empathy is cruel. I garentee you I know of what I speak; Ive already been your victim before. In addition to my previously mentioned afflictions I also suffer from severe allergies.  This complicates medication matters greatly, but nowhere more so than with my pain medicine. I spent most of the last 11 and 1/2 years on Methadone, but when my speech & gross motor skills became affected a change was in order. I then spent a period of some months trying desperately to find something that would both match the pain & not cause anaphylaxis. After trying 5 different pain medicines to no avail, I thankfully began Opana ER on 10/15/16 and happily used it, then the generic, until it was pulled from the shelves. My last was 11/29/17. I've yet to find anything that helped fight my pain the way it did. Opana, while being voluntarily pulled, was done so at the 'strong urging' of the government. No attempt was made to alter the pill to make it furthermore incorruptible. And while I most definitely do not want the drug addiction issue to continue as it has in our country,  one community should not have to suffer to help the other. The National Institute of Health study in 2012 identified  11.2% of Americans that suffer from 'Chronic Pain'. That is 25.3 million Americans. That study also showed that out of the 11.2% of people who said they experience ""Chronic Pain', 17.6% of them said they experience what they classified as 'Severe Pain. Being that the study is 6 years old, that number has most assuredly gone up and with our aging population I imagine it will only continue to grow over time. Being a Medicare recipient, I urge you to not do this. Since the implementation of the new guidelines of 2016, the intractable pain community has seen a dramatic increase of suicides. This change will do only damage, there had to be a more humane and logical approach to this issue. With our these medicines I surly do not know what I would do.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0442","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","WY"

Opioid prescribing should be a decision between the patient and their physician. The 90 MME was based upon flawed guidelines from the CDC in 2016. Even the CDC suggested their own recommendations were clinical guidance and it was not meant to be regulation. 

Suddenly dropping opioid doses will cause acute opioid withdrawal, exacerbation of pain, and increased disability with decreased productivity. It also increases the risk that patients will migrate to riskier alternatives such as heroin or fentanyl.

I am an addiction psychiatrist with 14 years of experience. I ran an opioid treatment program for 10 years and now work to treat opioid addiction in my practice. The proposed rule change is in the right spirit but very, very risky in reality. I urge CMS to reconsider the arbitrary dose limit on opioids.

"998","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm amazed at how the insurance industry has been authorized by CMS to influence the standard of care for treatment of intractable pain without consideration of credible scientific evidence. Fortunately, I am not a high metabolizer nor do I have genetic variations that interfere with the effectiveness of my medications.  However, many of my intractable pain patient friends will be impacted by your Agency's decisions to limit their daily dose.  

If enacted, your policies will force more patients onto disability because of loss of function and under-treated pain.  Ironically, CMS policies have already resulted in catastrophic iatrogenic injuries and increased the cost of healthcare in the U.S.  The opioid prohibition movement has provided excuses for large corporations to coerce chronic pain patients into more ""intervention"" (ie: epidural steroid injections, nerve blocks, spinal cord stimulators, etc.), and resulted in alarming numbers of victims of medical harm (including ADHESIVE ARACHNOIDITIS).  In other words, your policies are resulting in chronic pain patients becoming life-long intractable pain patients.

For example, let's look at the common back pain problem and a commonly used corticosteroid used to treat it (Pfizer's Depo-medrol).  Below is link to Pfizer/New Zealand Depo-medrol datasheet:

http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/Datasheet/d/Depomedrolinj.pdf

Note top of pg. 7:  ""Depo-Medrol may be used by any of the following routes: intramuscular, intra-articular, periarticular, intrabursal, intralesional and into the tendon sheath. It MUST NOT be used by the intrathecal, epidural or intravenous routes (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE EFFECTS).""

and bottom of pg.18:  ""ADVERSE EFFECTS

Administration by other than indicated routes has been associated with reports of serious medical events including: arachnoiditis, meningitis, paraparesis/paraplegia, sensory disturbances, headache, functional gastrointestinal disorder/bladder dysfunction, seizures, visual impairment including blindness, ocular and periocular inflammation, and residue or slough at injection site.""

We have to ask:  How in the heck did this harmful procedure become the ""standard of care"" for back pain?

Of course, FDA and CMS sold out to the interests of professional medical societies and hospital corporations (ie: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Kaiser Permanente, etc.).  Based on increasing numbers of arachnoiditis cases showing up in social media forums, we know arachnoiditis is NOT rare. Instead, arachnoiditis is grossly misdiagnosed for fear of legal liability;  adverse events are under-reported to FDA for the same reason.  
 
Please note opinion from Charles V. Burton, M.D., F.A.C.S., Editor-In-Chief, The Burton Report, regarding standard of care:  ""It must be clearly pointed out to the reader however that a harmful procedure can never be considered a standard of care by the medical profession.""

Also note comment written by Dr. Laxmaiah Manchikanti,  Chairman of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians in Pain News Network blog:

https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2015/8/19/experts-say-epidural-injections-overused

Laxmaiah Manchikanti, MD

""This is a very interesting perspective; however, there appears to be significant misinformation. All in all arachnoiditis is a significant problem which has been missed by multiple governmental agencies as well as physician organizations. It will not go away by ignoring it. All parties have responsibility. It can be avoided by utilizing alternate techniques, alternate drugs, and finally patients must also share responsibility. In the United States, no one can force anyone to have a procedure. Further, each and every patient should be educated about and understand the risks and benefits of any and all procedures and physicians should explain to them that steroids are an off-label use.""

You know there are problems when the Chairman of American Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) makes statement regarding arachnoiditis being missed by the Feds!

The question for CMS:  Who will treat complex intractable pain patients who have ""failed standard treatment"" - many now abandoned by physicians who are fearful of prescribing high dose opioids, thanks to our healthcare system (which has sold out to the insurance industry, ASIPP, ASA, Medtronics, Pfizer, etc.).  Medicare's reimbursement policies have essentially established a harmful standard of care. Your reimbursement structure has already created a public health crisis and millions of harmed patients - and now high dose opioids are the target of your policies?  

I find the irony and hypocrisy of your Agency to be absurd.  However, it makes sense when you look at it from one perspective:  PROFITS for large corporations who have purchased favors from the federal government and donated campaign contributions to elected officials.

Introduction to the Letter Attached as PDF

The 180 clinicians signing the attached, separate letter wish to register our shared concern regarding opioid-related provisions in the ""2019 Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2019 for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates, Part C and D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter, CMS 2017-0163."" The letter, titled ""Unhelpful and Risky"" was prepared on March 4, 2018. All signatures were collected in just 28 hours, underscoring the depth of our concern that patients will be put at risk if the proposed opioid-related provisions are enacted.

Three of us (Dr. Stefan G. Kertesz, Dr. Adam Gordon and Dr. Ajay Manhapra) prepared the letter. We are academic general internal medicine physicians with board certification in addiction medicine and a history of publication focused on addiction, primary care and current roles in enhancing opioid safety through our clinical work, research, and teaching. We have no grants, funding, honoraria or income related to the pharmaceutical industry now or in the past. Dr. Kertesz previously held privately-owned stock in Abbot and Merck (amounting to <3% of assets), sold in December of 2017.

The signature list for this letter was open to individuals with clinical degrees in fields such as medicine, pharmacy and nursing. All signatures represent individuals speaking on their own behalf. None speak on behalf of their employers, or any other organization with which they are affiliated. 

The list of signatories reflects deep and wide expertise directly relevant to the the CMS Proposal. 

The signatories include three persons who played roles in the development and finalization of the 2016 CDC Guideline on Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (Starrels, Cunningham, Bair). It includes two members of the Board of Directors for the American Board of Addiction Medicine (Friedmann, Samet), three past Presidents of the Association for Medical Education and Research on Substance Abuse (Alford, Samet), and two past Presidents of the Society of General Internal Medicine (Kroenke, Turner). 

A high percentage of respondents are active medical faculty at leading medical schools (several from Harvard, Yale, University of California San Francisco, Einstein, Boston University and Stanford). Moreover, our respondents encompass professional expertise in addiction, primary care, pain, pharmacy, nursing and palliative care. The respondents also include experts in opioid safety (Merrill, Alford, Manhapra, Webster, Gordon, Kertesz, Fox, among others), and psychological interventions for pain (Darnall). 

We understand that CMS, like all public and private agencies, seeks to foster a health system response appropriate to the magnitude of the crisis facing our nation. We hope you will read the attached letter with the understanding that we wish to be constructive while cautioning against actions that could do severe harm.

On behalf of the signatories,
Stefan G. Kertesz, MD, MSc

She gives me advise on how to handle things that mneed to be done to be sure I do right.and save money for my 1099s and when she couldn't even leave the house even after a year of trying everything else,  pain medication was the one thing after all her hard work that gave her back to us.  She participates in the medicade program,  and the idea that you would take and restrict her medications or give insures and pharmacies the ability to refuse or put limits nust because she is on medicade,  feels like your saying she don't matter.  She matters a great deal to my step dad and me and my brother.  I don't understand why this is happening.  She couldn't even help herself before and there are so many long waits appointments and hoops to jump threw.  She couldn't do it herself or even stay alone herself so for almost a year one of us was taking off work to try to help her.  Lately she has talked about hoping since she is getting stronger to go back to work,  she always loved caring for or helping elderly clean there homes and loved church being apart of things.  How could you possibly know what she needs or does not need.  I was against her taking pain meds until I saw how she improved,  I hated the idea of pill poppers and I was so wrong.  I can't watch my mom deteriorate again when she don't have too.  Medications that work for her should stay available to her she don't desevere to be picked on or harned.  All I know is that these meds have WORKED for her.  I know what I have seen first hand.  My mom has always taught us to be strong and independent and she also never drank alchole or smoked cigarettes like I saw my Dad do,  me and my brother were always so proud of her for that and I think thats why we don't .  I don't really know what I should write except that my is the strongest person I know, she started to advocate for herself because she is not a quiter she has shown us we can make a difference.   I do not think you should limit her meds and I do not like the direction our country is turning to treat people this way.  Its wrong.

I am writing to you to let you know why I need access to my pain medications as prescribed by my doctor or pain specialist.
I am a 61 year young woman and am in chronic pain constantly without my opiods. They are helping me to live a normal life as I should. I travel, can cook, clean, drive my car, go grocery shopping. I am independent. Without my medications I would be in my bed crying like a baby and in so much pain that I can't walk. Furthermore, without my opioid I can not use my left leg. It will drag beside me. I do not take these to get a high! 
Also, I have tried acupuncture, spinal injections, physical therapy, massages, neurontins or gabapentins, which do not work for my chronic pain.I have also had 2 lumbar spinal surgeries and they did not make me better, not even a little bit! The pain meds that I receive help me so so very much.
I do not agree with the 90 m me because every ones pain levels are so so very different. And we should not be all clumped together as one person with same pain levels. It took years to finally find the right solutions for my issues. Yes, they are wonderful! I get to live my life well. Please do not change the milligrams per everyone and make the same.

We would like to take the opportunity to comment on those changes where we feel a modification is warranted and on changes for which we have concern. 

Clustering Methodology: Gateway believes there are shortcomings in the current clustering methodology used to assign Star measure cut points to the majority of measures. This methodology is highly sensitive to performance outliers, which can result in Star measure cut points that do not accurately reflect industry performance trends across Part C and D measures. Outlier contracts, especially those with low enrollment, have the ability to establish the 5- or 2- star thresholds due to highly differentiated levels of high or low performance. The performance of these contracts is often erratic and not sustained over time. We recommend that CMS acts to ensure that the cut points are reflective of industry trends. CMS could consider an alternative method or introduce a modification within the current method, such as excluding extreme outliers, prior to the running of the cluster for assignment of cut points to limit the influence of potential extreme outliers. The outlier contracts may still receive a Star rating, but will be excluded from the calculation used to establish the cut points.
Statin Use in Diabetes (SUPD): Gateway opposes the proposed future increase from a single weighted measure to a triple weighted measure. The current measure construct of requiring only a single fill for a statin more closely aligns to a process measure than to an outcome measure. Gateway encourages CMS to assess all Diabetes measures across both Part C and Part D, and consider them as a group as to their weight versus as individual measures. 
MPF Pricing Accuracy:  Gateway does not support the revision of this measure and recommends that CMS retire this measure because it does not provide beneficiaries with an accurate reflection of plan performance on pricing accuracy. The revision includes the frequency as well as the magnitude of pricing difference. The introduction of frequency increases the error in the measurement of pricing differences. Also, the frequency measurement can result in a disproportionate impact for drugs that have a high level of utilization, which makes this measure even more misleading to beneficiaries. Additionally, pricing differences between MPF and Point of Sale (POS) adjudication can occur as a result of natural fluctuations in the market price that occur outside of the CMS updates to Plan Finder.  Pricing differences can be a result of differences in reporting at the reference versus expanded NDC level and differences in rounding processes between POS adjudication and MPF. As a result, the MPF Price Accuracy measure is not under the control of the plan
Beneficiary Access and Performance Problems (BAPP): Gateway respectfully requests that the revised BAPP measure remain on the display page for two years. This would be in keeping with the plan as put forth in the Proposed Rule. Allowing for a minimum of two years on the display page promotes transparency and review of this significant change to using CAM data only.
Stratification for Adherence Measures: Gateway supports the proposed stratified reporting as it offers the potential for greater understanding of population-level differences.  Gateway requests consideration for CMS to provide this information in conjunctions with the monthly safety reports. Should CMS plan to incorporate these risk adjustments into the ratings for these measures, Gateway requests that CMS provide sufficient time and information to allow plans to monitor the impact of this change. Additionally, for all PQA-driven medication measures, we would prefer if drug lists can be updated monthly versus annually.

The idea that the government would further restrict pain control from a population of patients that desperately needs it to function is unconscionable.  This is not a Dr driven epidemic and evidence has shown that every time a new governmental regulation has come down on opioids, states, insurance companies and pharmacies have followed suit so this decision will have a ripple effect.  At the same time that opioids are being restricted from legitimate, responsible pain patients such as myself the addiction problem is not going away and it only grows.

"1012","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"As a member of the board of directors of the National Adult Day Services, I am writing to voice my support for CMS for its proposal to expand the scope of the primarily health related supplementalbenefit standard (pp. 182-183) to benefits that enhance beneficiaries' quality of life and improve health outcomes. As a trade association speaking on behalf of an estimated 5,400 adult day service providers, NADSA believes adult day services (ADS) meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance to include ADS in plan offerings.

According to a 2010 study by MetLife, ""adult day services (ADS) centers are a key provider of long-term care services in the United States. (ADS) provide a program of activities, health monitoring, socialization, and assistance with daily activities which allows individuals to continue to live in their homes and receive needed care in a supportive, professionally staffed, community-based setting"" (https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2010/mmi-adult-day-services.pdf). Key findings of the MetLife study include:
	Adult Day Services Are a Growing Source of Long-Term Care with services being provided to more than 260,000 participants and family caregivers in an estimated 5,400 centers across the country (CDC, 2016, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsltcp/NSLTCP_2016_survey_methodology_documentation.pdf).
	Adult Day Services Provide Comprehensive Skilled Health Care with nearly 80% of adult day services centers having a nursing professional on staff, nearly 50% having a social work professional on staff, and approximately 60% offering case management services to meet the physical, emotional, and social needs of participants and family caregivers.
	Adult Day Services Are a Preferred Platform for Chronic Disease Management serving participants with (usually multiple) chronic diseases including hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental illness, and cognitive/developmental disability.
	Adult Day Services Are Leaders in Community-Based Care for Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias with nearly half of participants living with some type of dementia including Alzheimer's disease.
	Adult Day Services Are an Essential Source of Support for Family Caregivers as ADS provides support and respite to family caregivers, and allows them to continue to be employed.

It is also worth noting that managed care organizations, private insurers, andlegislators such as Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ben Cardin and Reps. Linda Sanchez and Lee Zeldin have also recognizedvalue of ADS in legislation (S.309; H.R.1005; H.R.3098).

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on CMS-2017-0163-0007. I strongly encourage CMS to recognize and promote adult day services as one of the expanded health-related supplemental benefits to be included in MedicareAdvantage Plans during the bidding process.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0321","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Lyn Geboy-WI"

Re: CMS-2017-0163; Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter - Proposal to Permit Substitution of Prescription Drugs with OTC Drugs and Dietary Supplements 

Dear Administrator Verma:

The National Lipid Association (NLA) wishes to offer our comments on the Part D provisions of the proposed draft Call Letter titled, ""Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for Medicare Advantage (MA) Capitation Rates, Part C and Part D Payment Policies and 2019 Draft Call Letter,"" and particularly the proposal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to permit Part D Plans (PDPs) to substitute dietary supplements for prescription drugs in the Medicare Prescription benefit.  

The Draft Call Letter (Part II), page 197, proposes to allow PDPs: ""to include additional OTC products such as dietary supplements and cough medicines, without the requirement that either product offset the use of a Part D drug.""   Dietary supplements are not equivalent to, and cannot be substituted for, prescription drugs; and they cannot be used to treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate disease.  Instead, dietary supplements are ""food""  not subject to any FDA approval and should not be in the Part D Prescription Drug benefit.  

The NLA serves to educate health care providers about treatment strategies for lipid disorders to reduce the risk of CHD, and specifically about hypertriglyceridemia and its risk for acute pancreatitis. Omega 3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, also known as fish oils, are very helpful to reduce triglycerides if used in high enough doses. Prescription strength omega 3 products are FDA approved for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, most omega 3 products sold in stores are actually supplements, and are not even OTC approved.

It may be that CMS intended only to permit OTC drugs to be substituted for prescription drugs and not ""dietary supplements"" as well. Whatever CMS decides to do about OTC drugs in the Part D program, we urge CMS to eliminate from the Call Letter any reference to dietary supplements.   

Thank you for consideration of the above comments, and please contact the provided organizational contact with questions that you may have.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0746","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","Brian Hart-FL"

Many disease processes have a symptom burden that negatively impacts quality of life, and many patients rely on a variety of medications and non-pharm interventions to continue to work, to raise their families, or simply to get through a day without significant pain. 

Many individuals have medical conditions that limit their ability to use non-opioid analgesics (and thus are relatively limited to using opioid analgesics), and others have higher tolerance to opioids and require larger doses to achieve a similar level of pain relief (versus opioid-naive individuals). Whatever the cause of requiring higher doses of these medications, I see no science-based rationale for placing q 90 MME daily limit on prescriptions, nor the 7-day initial prescription limit. These are clearly destined to impact patients' ability to treat the distressing symptoms of illness, whether while living a more active life, or while approaching the end of life.

"1021","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"To Whom it May Concern: 

Please accept this letter on behalf of the members of the Pennsylvania Pain Society and as comment on CMS-2017-0163's 2018 Draft Call Letter titled Improving Drug Utilization Review Controls (Opioids).
 
The Pennsylvania Pain Society (PPS) was established in 2016 to serve the thousands of physicians and medical professionals who care for the Pennsylvanians who suffer from acute and chronic pain. We represent advanced trained pain specialists and anesthesiologists, neurologists, family medicine, primary care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and elder care physicians and practitioners with a professional interest in acute and chronic pain.   We are an independent, not-for-profit association whose mission encompasses education, advocacy and leadership on issues relating to the multi-modal, individualized treatment of acute and chronic pain.

The Pennsylvania Pain Society wishes to officially voice our opposition to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to place new limits on pharmacies' ability to fill opioid prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed new limits call for ""hard formulary levels""that restrict the amount of opioids Medicare beneficiaries may receive under Part D.  These include a 90 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) daily limit and 7- day supply allowance, as well as limits on prescriptions for acute pain syndromes such as post-operative pain, traumatic injuries, etc.  While these limits reflect the CDC Guidelines on Opioid Prescribing (March 2016), this proposal fails to take into account the very nature of the Medicare Part D targeted patient population, i.e., individuals who are over age 65 and/or disabled. Furthermore, it ignores the explicit CDC caveat that individuals with serious, life-threatening illness and those with chronic pain at the end of life should be exempt from the CDC's aforementioned restrictions on prescribed opioids. Medicare enrollees are, in fact, the group most likely to suffer from serious illness: they have multiple comorbid conditions, many of which cause persistent pain, and they are clearly those most likely to be facing end-of-life health scenarios. 

In short, these proposed restrictions make no sense in the Medicare population. PPS shares CMS' concerns over injudicious or over- prescribing of opioid medications and its effect on the current and well-publicized overdose epidemic. We strongly support and endorse ongoing efforts to address this public health crisis. However, as current data indicate, opioid prescribing rates have exhibited a steady decline since 2010. Overdose death rates from legally prescribed opioids have likewise dropped, unfortunately with a consequential increase in the number of deaths related to illegal opioids such as heroin, carfentanil and sufentanil.  Limiting access to appropriately prescribed and monitored opioid analgesia for older and disabled Americans is not likely to eliminate the underlying problem of Substance Use Disorder or diminish opioid overdose deaths.   Rather, this proposal makes it much more likely that effective analgesia will be denied to those who truly need it.  

One of the primary duties of all Physicians and Practitioners is to relieve pain and suffering.  These proposed restrictions pose a direct threat to not only our ability to fulfill that responsibility but also to the care of all pain patients.  The Members of the Pennsylvania Pain Society strongly urge CMS to critically re-examine the specifics of this proposal and, at the very least, include an exemption for Medicare enrollees who suffer from serious illnesses and life-limiting conditions which are associated with severe and/or chronic pain.  This pain can be ameliorated with appropriate, accessible pain management strategies which must include the potential use of opioid preparations.

I understand the intent is to reduce dependency and death due to opiod abuse. I also understand the pressure you must be under to ""fix"" this dependency epidemic. Did you know that 75% of those with dependencies began with medication that was NOT prescribed to them? The science simply does not support the solutions to the opiod epidemic you are proposing.

I am 57 years young and medically disabled due to my health. I receive Medicare and am so very grateful for the lifesaving income and prescription coverage. I have an common variable immune deficiency , fibromyalgia, myalgic encephelomyelitis, bronchiectasis, asthma...and more. I am mostly housebound and am beginning the search for a caregiver who can help me while my husband is at work. I live with constant pain- every hour of every day, 24/7, 365 days a year. Due to my health, and following testing, I am functioning at the level of someone with heart failure, cancer and/or HIV. I also take pain meds. Tramadol, Flexeril and Gabapentin allow me to function enough to have dinner with my family, see my grandbabies, take a shower and on a good day- work on my embroidery. When someone is as ill as I am, has to get a new prescription every 7 days or has to reduce my prescription amounts, means I have to choose among my limited activities in which I can participate. Without appropriate pain control, I can not sleep, have a telephone conversation, take a shower or get out of bed. My quality of life, as narrow as it is currently, becomes even more limited. Physically going to a doctor means 2-3 weeks of recovery in bed. If I had to go to the doctor for every refill, I would be permanently bed bound. I do not abuse my medications but these proposed restrictions on my medication would be devastating for me and my family. The restrictions you are proposing, gravely harm patients like me. Please don't take away the quality if life I am desperately trying not to lose. Limiting the medications I must take to function and that are carefully prescribed by my doctor will mean debilitating pain with no relief. Please let my doctors, specialists in their field, decide what medications I need- not a system that knows nothing about my medical history or unique pain control needs. I can't even pick up my prescriptions on my own. Going to a doctor more frequently, completing endless paperwork, telephone conversations with doctors, Medicare and pharmacies that these changes would require, will end any quality of life I am desperately clinging too. Please consider the full impact of limiting access to medications for patients like me who need to function every hour of every day.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0078","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Anonymous-NC"

As a federal prosecutor my line of expertise was the litigation of health care fraud cases. I am also a retired US Army Reserve Officer, having served in Saudi Arabia as the Executive Officer of a 400 bed MASH Hospital during Operation Desert Storm. I am a veteran with a service-connected disability.

Throughout my career working in the health field in Puerto Rico, I have realized the extremely negative impact that the limited and insufficient Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and funding to local providers and contractors has had in the delivery of health care to beneficiaries in the Island. It has also resulted in a deficiency in the quality and quantity of health care to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, and an extraordinary and massive immigration of beneficiaries, physicians and other health care providers to the mainland, leaving the Island with little or no medical specialists. I have witnessed the impact and detrimental effect of this policy in the medical services available even to the veteran population here. In addition, the health care providers and contractor are required to meet the same health quality standards as their peers in the US mainland, while getting comparable minimal or insufficient funding. This is an invitation to fraud, waste and abuse.

In view of the above, I request CMS to consider urgent and critical policy adjustments to assure appropriate funding for the health care programs in Puerto Rico, specifically the Medicare Advantage funding for 2019. The Medicare Advantage program is an important pillar of the healthcare system serving our elder and chronically ill patients. I endorse the position of MMAPA and the Puerto Rico Healthcare Community in their detailed proposals.

"1025","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"INTRODUCTION

I am the Medical Director for Palliative & Supportive Care at Orlando Health UF Health Cancer Center (OH-UFHCC). I serve on the Board of the American Academy of Hospice & Palliative Medicine (AAHPM). I chair the American Medical Association (AMA) Pain & Palliative Medicine Specialty Section Council and have served on the AMA's Opioid Task Force for the last 3 years. I have served on the Editorial Board for the Journal of Pain & Symptom Management since 2009. As a physician practicing outpatient palliative care for over 17 years, I am very concerned that CMS's proposed rule changes for opioid prescribing will severely impair my patients' quality of life.

90 MORPHINE MILLIGRAM EQUIVALENT (MME) LIMIT

Clinical Concerns

My patients suffer from severe cancer pain; their analgesic dosing is highly individualized and many require higher doses than 90 MME to achieve control of their cancer pain within accepted standards for palliative care. Adoption of a 90 MME limit will prevent many from achieving sufficient control of their cancer pain.
	
About 73% of cancer outpatients report difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions, half of these due to delays from requests for prior authorization [Kollas CD, Boyer-Kollas B. J Pain Sympt. Management, Feb 2018;55(2):663-4]. CMS directs sponsors to ""continue to apply specifications to account for known exceptions, such as hospice care; cancer diagnoses,"" but is unclear if exceptions will apply to cases ""previously determined to be medically necessary"" or if additional determination will be required. CMS should create an explicit exception or exemption to specify that an opioid is being prescribed ""for the treatment of cancer-related pain"" or ""for a patient enrolled in hospice care"" to prevent further delays in treatment for vulnerable patients.

Health Policy Concerns

CMS improperly legitimizes a 90 MME per day limit for opioids, which lacks an accepted scientific basis. The CDC Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain mysteriously included this limit after the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) rejected it via an unsolicited petition by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, PROP (Ballantyne JC, et al. 2012). Notably, PROP included no experts in hospice and palliative care 

CDC's inclusion of the 90 MME limit into the CDC Guidelines led to criticism from the AMA and AAHPM for a lack of transparency (Anson P. Pain News Network, Sept. 21, 2015), leading to a second open comment period. Ultimately, CDC exempted vulnerable populations, such as those receiving hospice and/or palliative care, who often require opioid doses exceeding the 90 MME limit. Including the 90 MME limit from the CDC Guidelines would mistakenly grant credibility to a false concept of an objective opioid limit. 


STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ABOUT FLAGS FOR GABAPENTIN AND PREGABALIN	

Efficacy & Off-Label Usage

Gabapentin is useful in treating cancer pain adjuvantly or alternatively to opioids. CMS proposes ""additional flags for high risk beneficiaries who use ""potentiator"" drugs (such as gabapentin and pregabalin) in combination with prescription opioids,"" citing ""increasing use of gabapentin for off-label indications, despite the lack of evidence from clinical trials,"" and that ""gabapentin is FDA-approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and the treatment of partial onset seizures."" Gabapentin is useful in treating neuropathic cancer pain and scientific evidence supports its off-label use: ""Gabapentin provides pain relief of a high level in about a third of people who take it for painful neuropathic pain"" [Moore RA et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rvw. 2014 April 27;(4);CD007938] and ""oxycodone/naloxone added to pregabalin or gabapentin provided additional relief and symptom control... without clinically significant safety concerns"" (Kim BS, et al. Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Dec 27. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12822).

Overuse

I have experienced only one case of overuse of gabapentin to relieve cancer-related pain in the last 17 years, corrected after an informed discussion about proper dosing. I have never experienced diversion involving gabapentin or pregabalin.

7-DAY LIMIT ON OPIOIDS FOR INITIAL FILLS

I am mildly concerned about a 7-day supply limit for ""initial fills of prescription opioids for the treatment of acute pain."" To avoid confusion, I strongly recommend that CMS add clear language that exempts patients with cancer-related pain or patients receiving hospice care from the 7-day supply limit for opioid prescriptions.	

CONCLUSION

I am very concerned that the CMS Proposed Opioid Rules will have negative consequences for many cancer patients. I recommend eliminating a 90 MME per day limit, which lacks a basis in science, and I urge CMS to create an explicit exemption for patients receiving hospice care or treatment of cancer-related pain to mitigate potential harm from these proposed rules.

"1027","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Dear Regulatory Officials,
Words spoken from the heart enter the heart --of both the listener and the speaker. . .  I hope you will take my words to heart!

I can absolutely appreciate the complex and complicated situation -- and the high level prioritized budgetary constraints placed on your agency. The cost of public service health care in the United States has long spiraled out of control. No disagreement there. But why deny and deprive the most needy and most vulnerable who suffer from chronic, unbearable, torturous pain on a daily basis from receiving the pain medication they so desperately need? 

Full disclosure: 15 years ago I suffered from the most unimaginable diabolical pain from herniated discs that my doctors confided was the most extreme case they had ever seen in all their years of clinical practice. 15 years later I can report that I was one of the ""lucky"" ones. My seemingly never ending nightmare with excruciating intense pain miraculously ended after 6 months. But I swear to you that at the time, each second of excruciating pain seemed like a never ending eternity. Unless you know first hand what the experience of ""unbearable pain""  does to the body, mind, heart and soul, there is simply no way to grasp it. Fortunately or unfortunately, I now have personal knowledge (and unforgettable memories) of the unmentionable thoughts that are in the back of the mind of every single patient who suffers from chronic, unbearable, incurable pain. I am now and always will be a living witness to that most traumatic phenomenon.

I am writing this note in behalf of all medicare and medicaid patients that will be effected by the anticipated cuts in services. I have absolutely no pecuniary interest and derive no personal benefit in any matter shape or form from submitting this letter, other than my strong belief that it is the proper, decent and morally right thing to do. As a lifetime educator I recognize the value of advocating for those who have no voice and are to powerless to advocate for themselves. I cannot and will not turn a blind eye to the suffering of others in my community whom I personally know will be affected by the intended cuts in services. 

In memory of loved ones, friends, relatives or parents you may have lost to the ravages of painful inoperable, incurable diseases, I beg you to consider and reconsider the life sustaining virtues of empathy, compassion and understanding for those less fortunate due to fortuitous and random circumstances outside of their control.

Thank you for your kind attention in realizing your ability to bring about a good outcome for those nameless and faceless Americans who so desperately depend on you to take a stand and to do the right thing. 

Thank you,

Most Respectfully Yours,
Arthur Miller

"1030","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have severe chronic pain, am a married 30 year old mother to two young children and was on my way to finishing my degree in Psychology with a dual minor in child and adolescent development and addiction studies before my doctor dropped me after disclosing her inability to continue prescribing medications because CDC guidelines say they are not to be used for chronic pain patients for dependence ... I'm not an addict begging for drugs on the street, i have multiple vertebral tumors that cause pain and bone spurs growing in my spine that cause spinal nerve compression leading to widespread nerve pain, surgery is not indicated due to my age and fear of arthritis and failed surgery syndrome. I have tried chriopractors, accupuncture, massage, physical therapy, aquatuic therapy, medications, herbs, and everything else i could think of to stop the pain; it is relentless. I was dependent upon opiates to lessen that pain so I could maintain functionality, and to be a mother to my children but without them I am left suffering from excruciating daily pain. I was dependent, yes, but that is a very different thing than being addicted. Not just based on my opinion but the scientific knowledge that dependence and addiction are not synonymous. I now am unable to find another doctor willing to treat me, my quality of life is dismal, and I am no longer able to be a productive member of society. All because my doctor discontinued my medications due to misinformation in the CDC guidelines. Although opiates have not been found effective, they have not been proven ineffective either! No long term studies have been done to prove or disprove efficour at all. It is unfair to be misleading our nations medical providers in an attempt to quell a mental health issue. You are slowly killing two populations and genuinely not helping anyone by putting inhumane restrictions on how patients can be treated by their doctors. You are, in essence, practicing medicine without a license and assuming a one size fits all position where people need to be treated individually as a matter of safety.

"1034","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA," I am a chronic pain patient with a permanent broken back from a tragic no-fault auto accident 3.5 years ago. A supposed drunk driver ran my car into a culvert. I was transferred from one hospital to another, and then I was in ICU for several days. I was the passenger and have no memory of the accident, but there were witnesses. The drunk driver hit and ran and was never found. 

After I realized I wouldn't heal and stop being limited and in pain, I tried tylenol, advil, herbal supplements, gabapentin, CBD oil, acupuncture, physical therapy (I actually have had PT since shortly after my accident), tens unit, quell, injections, massage, prescription creams and non of them help the pain. 

I quit taking my opioid prescription (with the knowledge of my pain doctor) last summer because of all the misinformation out there, thinking it might be true. I found that the information was wrong. They say that opioids do not work for chronic pain, that's a lie. Opioids do work for chronic pain, they are very effective. I had no trouble stopping taking the medication except that I was in horrid pain. The pain did not get better over the time I was off the medication. I was unable to get out of bed or even go to the bathroom unaided. I was beyond miserable and was unable to take care of myself or my children. If I was unable to return to my medication I would be unable to function, at all. I would have to rely on the government to take care of my kids and pay for inhome aids to take care of me including all self care. I would essentially need a full time care giver for me and my children. It would be impossible for me to leave my bed except when not avoidable, and then it would be a terrible hardship. I don't know how long I would be able to live like that. 

Picture yourself in the most pain you've even been in, and then picture it never ending, not even for a minute. If someone had medication that could help you to live a limited, but still useful life, and because other people could abuse the medication you use, your medial condition can't be treated? That doesn't even make sense. This doesn't make sense, is there an addenda? 

Have you even talked to chronic pain patients? Have you gotten involved with the lives you are proposing to traumatize or, in some cases, end? So many people are committing suicide because their medication has been taken away. 

I have a pain contract. I have to submit to UAs whenever my doctor requests with is random but ends up being several times a year (at $1800 a pop). I have never gone up on my prescription, ever. My medication works as well for me today as it worked three years ago when I first became injured.

I am not on medicare, but my insurance company follows what happens with the decisions you make regarding it. I have already had to put up with a bunch of inappropriate red-tape and unacceptable insurance changes justified because of the CDC recommendations. 

I wonder how long it will be before we find a way to gather a class action suit? Refusing to treat valid medical conditions is wrong and more important it is possible against ADA and the law. 

I hope it comes to that, the studies you are using are false and not supported by by proven studies, everyone genetically metabolizes medications differently, the CDC guidelines were written outside the rules by non-pain management physicians, some who may have professionally or personally profited from the outcome.These policies could: create more chronic pain by not treating acute pain, scare more doctors out of pain treatment, create more demand for urgent care, increase the rate of expensive and possibly dangerous procedures, more disability claims/unemployment, and need for social services. 

Force involuntary tapers, withdrawals, risk of suicide, high blood pressure, stroke risk, and cardiac issues. 

I am disabled, NOT over 65 and pain medication helps me PREVENT falls by stabilizing my pain. 

My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare.

A 7 day supply while seeking an exemption to 90MME would cause extreme stress, paperwork burden for my doctor, extra copays at pharmacy/doctor, plus another trip to doctor/pharmacy when you are in pain. A 7 day limit on prescriptions for new patients would be a physical and financial hardship - doesn't take into account injury, size, metabolizing, genetics or other factors. 

Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue. As long as we are targeting the  chronic pain patients (who have valid medical conditions) vs addicts who will use anything to get high including but not limited to opioids), we will never solve this problem. We need an exemption for legacy patients already stable on dosages above 90 MME .","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0395","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","OR"

The ongoing unilateral media and subsequent government focus on the negative side of opiate use has directly and profoundly affected those who suffer from chronic pain by making it more difficult to find relief. There are millions who suffer chronic pain from diseases that are not life limiting but that profoundly affect their daily lives. There are millions who depend on and benefit from appropriate pain management in order to live fully productive, fulfilling lives. Chronic, untreated pain costs our society billions of dollars annually in lost productivity, 

As a nurse for the past 22 years, I have personally witnessed the trend that began (appropriately) with noticing and addressing pain to the current environment where health-care workers, often the most ""educated"" clinicians,  treat those in pain with attitudes of judgment, blame and even name calling: ""drug seeker"", ""addict"" or ""junkies"" rather than treating them with appropriate medications, often because of fear of reprisal for using opiates appropriately. 

Chronic, untreated pain leads to anxiety, depression, disability and even suicide. I've personally witnessed many who have wished for death or attempted to take their own lives because of chronic untreated pain. The pendulum swing from assessing and treating pain to focusing inappropriately on pain treatment rather than on the actual problem of pain itself, has had profound negative impact on millions of people. Making it more difficult to find relief by penalizing providers and limiting access to medications instead of focusing on solving the problem of improving treatment for chronic pain Is the most heartbreaking travesty of modern day medicine.

The opioid problem is not due to legitimate pain patients or their doctors. It is quite clear when a doctor is overprescribing, but it's not because they prescribe high doses to people who need them; it's because they prescribe opiates to a ridiculously high percentage of their patients, very early in the relationship.

"1039","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"This is to respond to Proposed Medicare Changes to Opioid Prescribing (2019):

I am a neurologist specializing in pain medicine, having been in practice for 30 years.  Ours is a tertiary referral chronic pain medicine referral practice, being sent the worst of the worst pain problems in Eastern Virginia.  By this, I mean that we are asked to treat patients who have failed all other approaches, including (and especially) surgery and injections.  In addition to spinal disasters, we see end-stage abdominal pain problems (ulcerative colitis, multiple surgeries, Crohn's, etc), destructive joint disease (often having had multiple joint replacements) such as RA, SLE and psoriatic arthritis, refractory head pain syndromes and on and on.  The only reliable treatment that has reduced pain and improved quality of life for many of these patients is opioid, often dosed above the CDC ""guideline"" MME 90 level.

I am appalled that there is a consideration to effect a procrustean limit of MME 90 for these patients.  In our practice we daily work to observe best practices and constantly strive to use as little opioid (and other medication) as possible to achieve the twin goals of lower pain and improved function.  If a universal ""limit"" of 90 were implemented, three general things would happen: 1) There would be patients who would simply suffer, their quality of life markedly deteriorating; 2) There would be a number who would pursue pain control through whatever means, even illegal or improper, such as buying prescription analgesics or even resorting to street drugs such as heroin; and 3) Those that would simply be overwhelmed and despair enough that they would end their lives through suicide.  Over the weekend I attended the funeral of a neighbor who suffered from chronic pain who did just that, using the family pistol.

The CDC guidelines point out an inflection point where in the VA system, patients with an MME of 98 were at higher risk for opioid overdose.  As has been pointed out by many in the pain field, the applicability and methodology of this study is highly suspect.  The number that was chosen for the ""cut-off"" (MME 90) has been picked up by insurance companies and used to limit care.  Given the increased federal and state scrutiny surrounding opioids, the work involved in treating for pain patients has markedly increased.  However, our practice has learned to operate in the new environment.  For another federal agency, particularly CMS, given its clout, to make MME 90 a ""hardened"" limiting number would throw a bomb into the care of chronic pain patients.

The effect of the CDC guidelines has been clear: opioid prescribing has been declining for years.  However, heroin deaths continue to increase.  The over-dose problem is complex and highly related to societal factors (the ""Diseases of Despair"").  To insist purely on a linkage of heroin abuse to legitimate opioid prescribing for chronic pain is wrong.  I am very concerned that another class of victim is being created in the opioid epidemic frenzy--the chronic pain patient who can no longer get access to treatment.  One often hears of the pendulum having swung hard to one side, and I think that it has done so.  I was hoping that we would see something of an upcoming correction but this new proposal causes me to fear otherwise.  Please help us as we care for these very difficult patients--don't make it even harder.

"1040","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a patient with an intractable spinal cord condition called adhesive arachnoiditis, which I contracted from a medical error during spinal surgery six years ago. The damage to my spinal nerves is irreversible and has left me with 24/7 burning, stabbing and gripping pain from my lumbar spine down my legs. Opiate medication, while it doesn't eliminate the pain, lessens it enough to enable me to participate in my family's life. Without this medication, I would always be in bed, writhing in pain. With it, I am able to help raise our two teenage children, take daily walks, and do some household chores. Currently I am on private health insurance through my husband's employer, but I will be a Medicare patient once I reach that age (I am 57 now).

I am writing to urge you to not force limitations on the dosage of opiates prescribed to intractable pain patients. Yes, of course, too many opiates were prescribed in the early 2000's and the pill mills were an atrocity. But both of these practices have been stopped. The problem to be addressed now is the fentanyl flooding into our country's illegal drug supply. Restricting legitimate pain patients' access to their necessary medications does nothing other than violate our human right to a tolerable level of existence. It is as if a group of people had begun to abuse insulin, and diabetes patients were told, ""You no longer can have insulin because of this."" 

If there were an alternative to opiate medication for controlling my intense pain, I would be all over it. The reality is that Oxycontin and Lyrica have proven to be the two core treatments for keeping the burning and stabbing from my damaged spinal nerves at a manageable level. Here are some of the treatments that I have tried and failed: 1) epidural steroid injections (did nothing, and, it turns out are contraindicated/risky for adhesive arachnoiditis), 2)  short-acting opiates (wore off too quickly to use as a steady form of relief, but I still use them for breakthrough pain, about once a week), 3) gababentin (had too many side effects with memory and concentration, so I was switched to Lyrica), 4) a TENS unit (didn't reach the deep-seated nerve pain I have), 5) lidoderm patches (also didn't reach the pain), 6)  a spinal cord stimulator (which gave relief for two years, allowing me to decrease my Oxycontin dose, but to which I became oversensitized -- i.e., it now creates a painful electrical sensation, rather than masking pain signals), 7) Nortryptyline (had to stop when discovered I have LBBB, a heart condition).

Alternative treatments which have helped me and which I still use are: 1) Meloxicam (concentrated NSAID), 2) OTC anti-inflammatory supplements Alpha Lipoic Acid, Palmitoylethanolamide, Omega 3, curcumin, (along with various vitamins and minerals), 3) neuroplastic brain retraining techniques (I'm in a long-term class and do daily meditation and other exercises), 4) core-strengthening PT exercises (part of my daily routine, along with gentle yoga and walking), 5) myofascial release (bi-weekly), 6) acupuncture (weekly).

In sum, I have either tried or am using every alternative that is often proposed to opiates, yet opiates (and Lyrica) remain at the core of my treatment. Their effectiveness hasn't diminished over time, nor have I ever felt tempted to abuse them in any way. I do not feel any sort of ""high"" from the Oxycontin. All it does is diminish the all-encompassing pain I experience from my nerve injury. I don't drink alcohol at all anymore, as I value my life and safety.  I keep my medications secure and am especially careful to safeguard them when traveling. Every two weeks, I lay out all my medications and supplements in pill organizers, so I am always on track with my doses. Every specialist I have consulted has told me that there is no cure for adhesive arachnoiditis, that the pain will continue for the rest of my life (and even progress), and that it is not realistic to expect to live completely without opiates. I would love not take any opiates, but I also am determined to participate in my children and family's life. 

Please don't apply arbitrary limits on the morphine equivalent dosing. Although it's important to keep educating doctors and patients about the risks of opiate medications and to always seek the lowest possible dose, people simply metabolize these medications at different rates. In my own case, I require relatively high doses to control my pain (I was at 180 mme, but have decreased to 105 mme by introducing alternative treatments). Now I am at a good balancing point between the pain and the negative side effects of the medication (memory and motivation issues).  A further reduction would certainly put me in bed more of the day and decrease my ability to carry out daily life activities and participate in my family's life. We have already suffered enough.

"1041","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Hello,

I am a chronic pain patient with a diagnosis that resulted from a botched nephrectomy.  For the past two years, it has become increasingly difficult to get the medications that allow me to work and have a reasonable quality of life. Now that I am a Medicare beneficiary, I am concerned that your proposed regulation will damage my medical care even more.

As a result of the increasing hysteria about pain medications, I have accumulated a significant amount of research that clearly shows that pain medications are NOT the driver of the current ""crisis"". Even the CDC, after pushing the most damaging medical ""advice"" in decades, is recognizing this.

I fear that the proposed regulations will make it increasingly more difficult for legitimate pain patients to get the care they need. The use of pain medications by responsible patients has already been ""criminalized"" by anti-opioid zealots. My own experience supports this. In the 6 plus years I have been using pain medications, I have never ""doctor shopped"", never sold medication, never requested early refills, never been non-compliant in any way. Yet now I am subject to tapering (I am now on 50% of my former dose, forcing me to take over 3,000 mg of acetaminophen daily to cope.  Now I fear that my health will be negatively impacted by this. 

I implore you to make your policy and regulatory decisions on evidence that has not been manipulated to support someone's agenda. 

Thank you for your consideration,

"1043","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"On behalf of over 5400 adult day services (ADS) providers and the families they serve, the National Adult Day Services Association (NADSA) commends CMS for its proposal to expand the scope of the primarily health related supplemental benefit standard (pp. 182-183) to benefits that enhance beneficiaries' quality of life and improve health outcomes. We believe adult day services meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance to include ADS in plan offerings.

Adult day services can reduce hospitalization and nursing home placement. Centers trained staff provide medical monitoring, personal care assistance, supervision for safety issues, exercise/therapy, healthy meals, therapeutic activities and memory treatment up to seven days per week, 12 hours per day, in a supervised, congregated setting. Most centers provide transportation, social work and care management services to assist participants in meeting their maximum potential. These services are generally provided at a daily rate which is much lower then in home care and nursing home care.
 
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on CMS-2017-0163-0007. We strongly encourage CMS to recognize and to emphasize adult day services as one of the expanded health-related supplemental benefits to be included in Medicare Advantage Plans during the bidding process.

"1047","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a 60 year old Medicare beneficiary suffering almost constant intractable critically debilitating pain. What CMS has done since 2016 and is proposing to do in 2019 is absolutely unconscionable, outrageous, and potentially, for millions, murderous. Yes, murderous. 
If Medicare pain patients suffer torturous pain because of the imposition of unjustifiable medication limits, and those patients then die because of the direct consequences of said limits, then that is murder. 
I'm sure those comments make many of you angry. The truth often hurts---a LOT. Please have the kindness and moral courage to read this through. 
I have severe multi-level degenerative disc disease. My cervical spinal stenosis is considered critical. I have many other conditions, including renal disease made far more dangerous by the absence of 1 kidney. I was born with just 1 kidney. My one kidney is failing and should never be subjected to any NSAIDS whatsoever.
I have had no less than 14 doctors over 10 years tell me that any NSAID use could kill me at any time. I am very thankful that Medicare pays for a 37.5 microgram fentanyl patch. It helps, but it is not nearly adequate. 
EVERY single extant medical text, document, or website states---unequivocally--that breakthrough pain medication (hydrocodone or oxycodone or some such similar med) should ALWAYS be prescribed along with the fentanyl transdermal patch--without fail...EVERY single time.
I was confronted by a tag team of 5 physicians last July at Albany Medical Center when being treated for ulcer and gastritis that was caused by me taking NSAIDS for pain---against the orders above. 
After a 2 hour verbal repartee, 5 young intelligent physicians surrounding the bed of an old, broken down man, being forced to admit intellectual and moral defeat--I was given a letter and prescription for the fentanyl transdermal patch and 4 10 mg oxycodone tablets per day for the inevitable and almost constant intractable breakthrough pain.
I love my general practitioner--he is a caring and good man. However, he acquiesced to the letter and the fentanyl patch but not the MEDICALLY REQUIRED breakthrough pain medications. You see, CMS has imposed a 90 MME limit--totally wrong in every conceivable way--absolutely arbitrary in every conceivable way--and the fentanyl patch--which is not enough--puts me squarely on top of that 90 MME limit. 
So, I take my deadly NSAIDS (4 to 6 at a time, 2 or 3 times per day), knowing that each one is a suicide pill and a kidney killer, but hey, folks can only put up with so much screaming in agony, right?
And so, I blithely take many ibuprofen, naproxen,  and acetaminophen tablets to deal with excruciating pain to keep from screaming every day while I should be taking a med that is proven in my case to stop pain cold and for which I have absolutely no addictive tendencies. 
I have never (as in never!!) displayed any sort of addictive tendency. I have never once had a single drop of alcohol of any form whatsoever--how can I get any more demonstrably emphatic than that?  And so, a once great country allows the misbehavior of addicts to determine the course of medical treatment of someone who has never transgressed chemically? What possible sense does that make---in the slightest?  ZERO SENSE....
Since when did a government bureaucrat at any level qualify for a medical degree??

I talked to 3 neurologist and 2 RLS specialists' and they don't know what else. It is just not torture, it's hell.

Some of us, like me, have literally tried every  drug, lotion and potion and they don't work. Opioids gives us a q quality of life that we would not have. We don't pop pills to get a high, I have been using these drugs for 15+ years and never once been high. Over the last 10 years, I have seen 3 neurologist, 3 RLS Specialist, 4 sleep Doctors and have been told that their is nothing more that we can do. That their are some of us that have no chance for any type of life.

We are not getting the prescribed medications from a drug dealer. We are getting these medications from a licensed doctor who has examined, poked, prodded and run tests to find out what can help. There are hoops and T's that we have to cross.  There are no viable alternatives for many of us who use's approved opiates under doctor supervision. We are not using these pills for recreational use. We are using them, so we can get out of bed and live a somewhat normal life.  I have been on opiates for over 15+ years and when I miss a dose or run out and forget to refill it's a total disaster. I don't get any withdrawal symptoms no headaches or anything that goes with that. Just pain severe uncontrollable pain that the opioids helps to make tolerable.

I understand that opioids are complicated. People are different; opioid-induced analgesia exists. I also recognize that as a public health matter, the interests of treatment must be balanced against the potential for abuse. But serious physical pain needs to figure into the conversation, especially since severe or persistent pain affects 25 times more Americans than opioid abuse. I worry that we are throwing out the baby with the bath water. By focusing on a single substance, we are not addressing the root causes of addiction. By placing undue pressure on physicians and the doctor-patient relationship we abandon people in severe pain, many of whom could contribute and lead productive lives, to their suffering.

Now days nobody must ""just accept"" anything about themselves, unless you are a chronic pain patient

Suddenly, opioids are now being considered evil and all must be destroyed. We must learn to ""accept our pain"". I don't want to just accept my pain, any more than someone who feels that they were born the wrong gender should be forced to stay that way forever and just ""accept"" it.

People, who NEVER would have before, will be going to the black market, and there will be MORE deaths, and these lives that are lost WILL BE ON YOUR HANDS.

I live in Houston, TX and Boone, NC. I was very active and healthy in 2002, studying to become a Personal Trainer, in the gym 5 days a week and biking 50 or so miles a week. I ran my own graphic design business when all of a sudden I had back pain that would not stop. After a year of trying NSAIDs, TENS, chiropractic, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage RF injections and steroid injections I came to the conclusion that surgery was my last option and I should take it. I had a herniated disc at L5-S1 and Spondylolisthesis. My surgery was on 3/31/2003, that day my whole life changed. 

The surgery was not a success. I had different and worse pain than when I went into the hospital. It took the hospital 5 days to call in a Pain Management specialist. He prescribed Fentanyl patches, which knocked the pain down and I have been prescribed them ever since, almost 15 years. This pain is nerve pain, it does not stop, it travels from my low back down my left leg to my foot. I have had 4 subsequent surgeries to try to alleviate the pain. After the last surgery I was told that there was nothing else that could be done for me and my only hope was that future research might come up with a solution. Due to failed back surgery I'm a chronic pain patient, not by choice. Two years later, in 2005, I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. I had a radical mastectomy, chemo and radiation treatments. Because of Chronic Pain I'm unable to sit more than a few minutes without increased pain, same for walking and standing. My days in the gym and bike riding are over. I applied for Social Security Disability and was accepted November 2006.  

The Fentanyl patches are a huge help they cut the sharpness and intensity of the pain. They enable me to sit long enough to write this piece. I get up, walk a bit and come back to it. They enable me to sleep, thank God. I'm able to have a better quality of life as without this medication I'd be in unbearable pain and feel I'd lose hope. Pain takes a terrible toll on one's body and mind. I don't consider myself an addict. I'm prescribed the same dosage of Fentanyl patches since 2006, I'm not craving more, I do not get high and I do not doctor shop as I do not need more medication. 

If you are to lower the amount of allowed medication to 90 MME I would be thrown into horrible, intense pain and withdrawal. Not to mention I'd have to sell my house and move to Houston full time to fill my prescriptions if I could not get a 30 day supply. 

Why do you believe my chronic pain has anything to do with opioid addicts who are using theses drugs to get high? Why punish me and others like myself who have these painful conditions that we are trying to cope with and take our life saving opiate medication away or cut back to dosages that simply will not help us? Are you trying to euthanize us? 

Opioids are a lifeline in a world where much has been taken from us. There will always be people that abuse drugs. Blaming the drug is not the answer. Addicts have other life issues that compel their drug use. From my own experience and meeting other chronic pain patients who are prescribed opiates, I believe that these drugs are NOT what cause addiction. We use them as our therapy, to live, not to get high and abuse. We are trying to survive and these drugs are very helpful in that regard. If you pull them from the market or reduce dosages to 90 MME are you prepared to place patients that rely on this medication into facilities where we can safely, transition to another type of treatment? What would that be? Who would take care of monitoring us during the withdrawal period? This is very serious. People die in withdrawal and as a Medicare patient I would ask to be treated during this time. I fear many chronic pain patients will attempt suicide or turn to illicit drugs which are unsafe to cope with their pain because of these proposed cutbacks. I believe this is the wrong way to deal with opioid addiction.

I ask that my voice be taken into consideration. My greatest fear is that I'll be denied opioid medication and left to cope with intractable pain and withdrawal alone and that I won't survive.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0239","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-02T00:00:00-05:00","Carla Cheshire-TX"
"1056","CMS",FALSE,2,NA,NA,"I am a general internist-researcher studying chronic pain. I agree with the plan to reduce use of opioids but I believe this has to be done by the physician in collaboration with the patient, gradually. 90 days is a short time to change management for patients who have been treated for years. It can be done safely and it is being done. 

CMS should be paying for effective, non-drug options such as chronic pain self management training and support instead of making short-sighted regulations about opioids. Our group has been studying what patients with chronic pain want  - such as support for safe exercise training, stretching, nutrition (yes weight has alot to do with it), massage.  Medicaid and Medicare do not financially support the services that patients need to improve how they live with chronic pain. Do not make regulations without understanding the entire spectrum of pain care. 

Lastly our research has found in a representative sample of Hispanics in five states that the public has limited understanding of chronic pain. We should be doing more primary prevention - spend our money on education and support for the public to understand the limited role of opioids and the complexity of managing chronic pain.

"1058","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have been a chronic pain patient for 20 years now. I have CRPS because I was sitting stopped in traffic on an interstate one sunny afternoon with my two toddlers and a man in a truck behind me chose not to stop, or even slow down. Fortunately I was able to steer my van off the road without hitting anyone else, but that was the first moment the pain seeped into my body. With each hour it grew worse until it became the searing, burning pain I continue to live with today. It took two unnecessary surgeries, and a couple of more years to diagnose as CRPS. I am treated like a drug seeking pariah wherever I go, though I rarely am asking for pain meds. Usually I want an ex-ray because I've fallen and hurt myself. I go to a pain doctor. I follow all of the rules. I've never had a bad drug test. I don't have a bunch of requests for increases in the dose of my pain medication.  I try all of the nerve blocks and such that will help me get by with less medication.  However, what I do have, I need. I don't need an insurance company,  a pharmacy or a government who has never met me making arbitrary decisions about my medical care. Yes I have Medicare.  Does that somehow make me less human, less worthy of appropriate care?  I am always in pain, even with the medication I take.  Should I be in debilitating pain, such that I can no longer dress and feed myself? With these arbitrary medication rules for chronic pain patients,  are you wanting them to go out and search for street drugs, or just kill themselves outright and save you the trouble? I have had the suicide disease for 20 years and watched many friends go down the rabbit hole. I hate watching you push more.

"1069","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My husband is an intractable pain patient, suffering from Adhesive Arachnoiditis, I am his advocate, concerned about the unintended consequences of various efforts under way to combat the prescription opioid drug abuse crisis we face today. We've only seen an occasional brief mention about the many chronic pain patients benefiting from these medications. Very little attention has been given, to whether these patients are going to be able to continue their much-needed medications if restrictive prescribing guidelines are enacted. There are millions of chronic pain patients, who will never get the help they need because of these regulations. I write to you today, as the family member of an intractable pain patient and also as his advocate, who is facing great challenges with this guidelines, which sadly have been taken as rule or mandate, and not as a suggestive way of prescribing suggestion. These guidelines would deprive our family members of their treatments, which we know are effective and that are being used responsibly.  I want to make sure that efforts to combat prescription opioid abuse don't deprive my husband of his much-needed pain treatments, which we know are effective.

In these new prescribing guidance/policies, no provision is being made for long-term treatment of chronic and intractable pain patients. What has happened to the compassionate care? Many of us have to travel long distances at great expense financially, physically and mentally to receive care. Most pain management clinics are staffed with anesthesiologists, who focus on treatments such as epidural injections, invasive procedures, and surgical implants, which haven't worked for these severely ill patients, and sometimes cause more harm.

We must ensure that well-intended government policies, and prescribing guidelines do not unnecessarily restrict the use of opioid pain medications for people, who truly need them and use them responsibly. I would like for my husband, to have access to qualified physicians who can provide integrative, multi-faceted, standard and non-standard pain therapies including life-saving opioid medications at necessary doses. We urgently need insurance coverage for the medications, therapies and treatments needed for my husband to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Most importantly, we need physicians who are enabled to prescribe whatever treatments or medications they deem necessary, for intractable pain patients without interference from regulatory agencies, pharmacies, or insurance providers.  Without such physicians under treated patients, will continue to suffer, and some will die from the physiological impacts of living with inadequately treated pain.
 
Therefore, I ask you to please do not impose these retrograded guidelines, which fail to address the medication needs of long-term chronic and intractable pain patients.
 
One-size-do-not-fit-all, patients are a unique and truly suffer from chronic pain, didn't intentionally get a disabling disease, nor deserves to be under constant persecution, stigma and stress.

I am a Medicare patient diagnosed with RSD/CRPS (reflex sympathetic dystrophy, chronic regional pain syndrome)
I have had this condition for 36 years now and have tried so many different modalities as well as medications from NSAIDs and numerous over-the-counter painkillers etc.

Having had this condition for so long I cannot possibly remember every specific modality nor medication that I have tried. What I can say is that I have never given up the opportunity of trying something either new on the market or new to me from perhaps a different physician when I have moved from one location to another. I was originally in the United Kingdom when I was first diagnosed with RSD and moved several years later to the United States in Florida and then 12+ years later I moved from Florida to Pennsylvania.
I have always tried to keep with one physician in each locality and only changed or moved to a different doctor if recommended by the previous doctor I was seeing because he was no longer able to help me. Back in England prior to surgeries, I had numerous steroid shots put on my finger I had it strapped to my other finger next to it and splinted. I literally tried every possible noninvasive modality that was available in the mid-80s before allowing the surgeon to operate. Over the years I have had an excessive 20 surgeries including in the United States the implantation of a spinal column stimulator.
I managed to run my family business in the United Kingdom before emigrating to the United States than a small business in Florida and finally in Florida I was the production director of a large direct-mail company. I moved to Pennsylvania for a job offer that was impossible to refuse however the circumstances that I ultimately faced with this job were far from those that I had expected.
As a result, I suffered numerous flares of the RSD to the point that I could no longer use my right arm and subsequently, my left arm and hand became so badly affected due to overuse I also suffered what ultimately became a serious low back injury.
I was only able to continue the stressful mental and physical work because during my time in the United States I constantly kept up with any advances and other suggestions of noninvasive modalities for my condition. Unfortunately just prior to the July 4 holiday in 2009 the cable in my spinal cord stimulator broke and I was forced to have it replaced which on the advisement of no less than five doctors I opted to have a somewhat newer type of stimulator implanted however this resulted in surgery not only on my mid back but also on my neck to actually stitch the the leads and the connections directly to the nerves That went down my arm unfortunately this surgery calls a massive flare that never settled back down and I was forced into taking opiate medications which I have unfortunately had to continue since 2010. I even had to accept taking permanent disability and still have to maintain opiate medications just so that I can get out of bed and have some sort of life.
I am poor you not to put restrictions on these opiates as I am not the only person in this situation and it is critical that doctors aren't patients are allowed to prescribe and use such medications to give us at least a minimal quality of life.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0878","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-04-30T00:00:00-04:00","Julian Philips, Allentown, PA"

"1078","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm a 46 year old Medicare patient. Amongst my many unfortunate diagnoses is Intractable Pain Disease. The definition of intractable pain is ""pain that is excruciating, constant, incurable, and of such severity that it dominates virtually every conscious moment, produces mental and physical debilitation, and may produce a desire to commit suicide for the sole purpose of stopping the pain."" Intractable pain is fatal if not treated and controlled. I have been permanantly, incurably disabled since 2007. The cluster of incurable, progressive diseases I suffer with has invaded my muscles, joints, tendons, nerves, heart, and brain. I passed every single disease to my child in-utero before I knew I was ill. She bears the same diagnoses I do. She, too, must take high-dose opioid medication and is going to be an intractable pain sufferer for the rest of her life. She and I were milled through years of the same worthless ""alternatives"" numerous other gov't agencies and IP-illiterate MDs cite as the ""many strategies and treatments used to treat non-cancer pain,"" including low-dose opioids, without bothering to mention that they are completely and utterly useless for those of us with diseases that cause omnipresent, torturous pain. With ten years of the same constant (high) dose of extended release opioids, along with the 14 other meds I must take that are non-controlled, I've been able to grocery shop, take care of my home, and care for my child, who will never be well enough to care for herself. Until 14 months ago, that is, when we became collateral damage yet again in the govt's misguided attempts to stop the use of largely illicit drugs by forcing my doctor to lower my doses of opioids...the medication and perfected dose that took years of trial and error to achieve. The medication that allows me to stay alive, period. As a result of my illnesses, I'm 100% pacemaker dependent, with cardiomyopathy and an EF of 35%. Even slightly increased pain induces uncontrollable arrhythmias. Even if I had a normally functioning heart, adrenal, and immune system, which I do not, the massive stress of intractable pain will still kill me if I attempted to ingest what would equal 25mg/daily...lowered from the 190mg/daily (570MEQ) that I require. I've only been able to lower it to 120mg thus far and I am nearly non-functional. WHY? Certainly you must know forcing a one-size-fits-all dose on patients will result in many of us dying. I've done absolutely nothing wrong but to have the misfortune of being ill. I have never taken one milligram more of any medication I have ever been prescribed, and I have no remote idea what it feels like to be ""high."" I realize it dismays the CDC, CMS, and FDA to hear that patients who take high-dose opioids are not skipping around giggling and madly searching for more drugs, but that is not the case. Not only for myself, but for the hundreds of chronic and intractable pain patients I've been fortunate enough to meet. Not ONE of them is an addict, nor do they experience this oft-circulated claim of ""euphoria"" from their pain medication. My pain management specialist had to inform me, with tears in his eyes, that the CDC ""guidelines"" were now being enforced as the law as they were NEVER meant to be, and he was being strong-armed into lowering all of his patient's doses. This means taking a dose SEVEN TIMES LESS than what I must ingest to rise out of bed in the morning.  I've now spent the last 9 months writhing in pain in my bed, rising long enough to make my child one meal a day before crawling back into the bedroom again. Trying to function is nearing impossiblility, and I'm not even halfway down to how far I'm expected to decrease my dose. My respirations and heart function are so out of control with the massive increase in pain I've have that I am counting the days until I die. I've NEVER abused drugs. My life is hanging by a thread because a group of bureaucrats are using my child and I as sacrifical lambs for their ""opioid crisis"" which has NOTHING to do with pain patients. I don't need any doctor, politician, activist, or bureaucrat who is illiterate in intractable pain to save me from myself...Ironically by demanding my doctor prescribe my medication in a dose so low that I'll die. Leave us out of your drug wars. What kind of cowards attack the most helpless, disabled, sickest Americans under the guise of saving drug addicts? It appears that CDC, CMS, and FDA has either forgotten or is feigning ignorance regarding how highly effective opioid meds that were created to treat severe, round-the-clock pain are for millions of patients. They can't possibly not know that the information circulating about opioids being proven ineffective for chronic pain is a lie. Forcibly restricting high-dose opioids is reckless, indefensible, irresponsible, and most importantly, it is murderous.

University of Maryland Health Advantage, Inc. (H8854)

Enhancements to the 2019 Star Ratings and Future Measurement Concepts 
Page(s): 112

Removal of Measures from Star Ratings - Beneficiary Access and Performance Problems (BAPP): 

University of Maryland Health Advantage (UMHA) (H8854) supports the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to modify the current Beneficiary Access and Performance Problems (BAPP) measure by:

	Removing all enforcement actions and reductions for plans under sanction due to audit findings, and  
	Including only Compliance Activity Module (CAM) data. 

While UMHA agrees with the CMS proposed modifications to the measure specifications, it strongly encourages CMS to maintain the modified BAPP measures for Part C and Part D in the 2019 Star Ratings Program, instead of including them for the Display Page.  UMHA recommends CMS continue to observe the impact of these modified measures on future Star ratings and then take additional input from stakeholders to decide on whether to continue keeping the measures in the Stars Program, move them to the Display Page, or eliminate the measures altogether.

UMHA recommends that the modified measures be retained for following reasons:

1.	BAPP measures are the only measures (among all Stars measures) which demonstrate overall compliance related activities and performance of the health plans. 

2.	Achieving higher Star Rating for both BAPP measures (4 stars or 5 Stars) has significant impact toward the overall and summary Star Rating as each measure is 1.5 weighted. This provides additional motivation to maintain strong compliance activities at the health plan level. Throughout the year (2017 Dates of service), Health plans invested significant time and resources into reaching a high Star score.

3.	Per 2018 Stars details, more than 70% of the plans received 4 Stars and 5 Stars for BAPP measures according to National Averages for Part C and Part D BAPP measures. Many Health plans Star Ratings will be negatively impacted by the removal of these measures. 

4.	For Other measures such as MPF Price accuracy, CMS took into account this major impact on nationwide health plans Star Ratings and proposed to keep the current measure in the Stars program until modified measure is ready to be included in Stars program. CMS stated, 'removing this measure from the Star Ratings until 2022 would potentially lower sponsors' overall Star Ratings given most contracts receive high ratings in this measure'. Similar logic is applicable for BAPP measures as majority of nationwide plans will be impacted negatively due to removal of these measures.

"1081","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"To the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services,

I strongly object to the proposal to limit prescription opioids to 90 MME/day.  While the CDC guideline is helpful, this is not acceptable for many patients.  It will force the continuation of forced tapers, resulting in severe pain for those who have been on these medications for years and have developed a tolerance.  

As physicians involved in the care of patients with pain we are all too aware of the risks as well as the benefit of opioid therapy.  Many, including myself, do not believe it is appropriate for mandates from CMS to dictate individual patient dosing rules.  This will certainly cause more harm than good.

Experiencing chronic and acute pain without relief from pain medication such as opioids has led many to commit suicide.  Why, in this modern country, are innocent people being denied medical care?

Doctors have becoming increasingly scared to prescribe pain medication for their suffering patients.  They are genuinely afraid of being investigated by the DEA.   

Furthermore, these proposed regulations are not supported by ANY reliable science. 

Doctors and health officials are increasingly recognizing that control of pain leads to more rapid recovery for hospitalized patients, and can even cut costs.  Patients who have good post-op pain control (such as with opioids and NOT over the counter pills) are able to breathe better.  Deep breaths can prevent the development of pneumonia.  There were 56,832 deaths due to pneumonia and influenza in 2013.

When hospitalized patients are supported in their recovery with adequate pain medication (opioids), these patients are less likely to experience acute pain.

Treating acute pain in the hospital setting lowers a patient's risk of developing chronic pain later on. When people begin to feel pain, Webster says the body begins to set up an inflammatory process in the central nervous system that's ""hard to quiet down."" For some people, that inflammation begins to feed on itself and, once discharged from the hospital, patients may go on to experience pain for months, even years afterward.

This information can be found in an NPR article from November 16, 2009.  It is called ""To Help Healing, Doctors Pay More Attention To Pain.""

So, many people have committed suicide in 2016 and 2017- a direct result of the cut back of prescribing pain medication.  Also, people have been ""tapered"" with cruel swiftness from their opioid pain medication.  I care about these people.  They should NEVER been put in so much misery that they felt their best choice was suicide.  What has occurred for these people is criminal, but we all know that nobody will be held accountable for this.

Many pain patients are hoarding what pain pills they have left, so if the pain medication crisis becomes worse, they have a means to end their suffering and pain.  

Who can blame them?  Our government and our doctors have thrown them away as human beings.

Please remember that living pain free is a human right.  Let's save lives.  PLEASE reject the new proposed policies regarding opioids.  Thank you for your time.

"1084","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Enhancements to the 2019 Star Ratings and Future Measurement Changes
Gateway Health appreciates the focus on the continuous improvement of MA plan quality and member satisfaction. Moreover, we appreciate the thorough explanation of proposed changes for 2019 Star Ratings and request for comments. In large measure, Gateway supports many of the changes and enhancements outlined in the CY 2019 Draft Call Letter. We would like to take the opportunity to comment on those changes where we feel a modification is warranted and on changes for which we have concern.

Categorical Adjustment Index:
As one of the largest providers of D-SNP benefits, Gateway has a vested interest in ensuring that CMS fully recognize and account for the impact of social determinants of health on not only our dual-eligible beneficiaries, but also on the Star Rating methodology. We applaud the continued work with ASPE to test alternative methodologies and look forward to providing feedback on alternative proposals in the future. As work continues to develop a final methodology for this methodology, Gateway raises the following concern with the current interim solution: Gateway opposes the use of single year data to determine measures for inclusion. Year-over-year changes to measures included in the CAI methodology do not adequately capture the impact of social risk factors, rather they reflect the results of a snapshot of data for the calendar year. While CMS and ASPE continue to vet more permanent solutions to controlling the impact of social risk factors on Star Ratings and, hence, reducing the bias against SNPs in the Star Rating methodology, Gateway strongly recommends that CMS employ cumulative inclusion of measures into the CAI. For 2019, this would result in a more comprehensive lists of measures shown over three years to differ significantly for LIS/DE vs. non-LIS/DE beneficiaries.
High Risk Medication: Gateway recommends CMS consider retiring this measure due to the fact that the polypharmacy measures focus on the same classes of medications. 
Use of Opioids from Multiple Providers and/or at High Dosage in Persons without Cancer: Gateway does not support this measure on the display page in its current form because this measure includes the dosage criteria of 120 MME rather than the 90 MME currently recommended by the CDC. PQA has also indicated that they are evaluating proposed updates to align with the CDC guidelines of 90 MME per day as a high dose threshold.
Measurement and Methodological Enhancements: Gateway would like to voice our concern about the Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) instrument and its role in the Stars methodology. Use of a subjective, small sample survey to assess improvement/maintenance in physical and mental health is not an adequate substitute for objective clinical outcomes. This is compounded for SNP plans as HOS does not account for populations with high dual-eligibility or social determinant of health burdens. The allowance for completion by a proxy, while important from a non-discrimination perspective, introduces risk that different individuals may complete baseline and cohort surveys which would distort results. Both process and outcome measures can be impacted by this allowance. Gateway urges CMS to consider alternate methods to gather objective clinical data that can more accurately depict changes in mental and physical health status. In the interim, Gateway requests that CMS decrease the weighting of both the Improving or Maintaining Physical Health and the Improving or Maintaining Mental Health measures.

"1090","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Reducing me specifically to 90 Me daily will put me right back in the prison I was in right after surgery,  once again I will be unable to do the simplest of tasks and I will once again bedridden.  It would be kinder to hand out cyanide to chronic pain patients taking an equivalents of six 10mg oxy pills daily on medicare than make them go through such a vast reduction.  I was in a prison of pain before fentanyl and opioids entered my life, they have given me freedom to be up and about and to do normal daily activities like cooking and cleaning as examples.  I fell from a tree and destroyed my lower discs causing incredible pain as a result.  I went through 3 surgeries to correct my issues, all three failed resulting in scar tissue on my nerves.  My Doctor suggested Fentanyl to see if it would help with my pain.  I started with 50 MG and went up to 75 then to 100 mg with the upper end of the dose I really didn't need my oral pain supplements any longer but the side effects of the 100mg dose were too much for my system. I went back down to 75 mg and resumed oral supplements.  The first two years after my failed surgeries I was bedridden and unable to do the simplest household task.  Then fentanyl entered my life I could now stand for a hour and actually started the do things like change the bed sheets without massive pain.  With time and experience I discovered ways of doing things I used to do without thinking about it.  I started to do small things from before falling from a tree again, I found that the side effects of the fentanyl to be not as bad as I expected I even got a huge surprise in the fact that my GI tract now worked like it used to before my injury,  needless to say that was a huge relief.  

Opioids in general have given me relief from my pain not completely mind you but it has reduced the level to a point that I can now do most household tasks provided I'm careful.  Yes our country has an issue with drugs in general, yes people have died, and yes people who should have never been given opioids got them too.  Our drug problems will only go away until drugs in general they lose their attractiveness.  The dose a patient gets is the responsibility of the patients doctor, not our politicians, nor administrators.  Please let the doctors make the call as to what works for a patient and when I say doctor I mean someone who has an active practice seeing patients daily not someone who has a medical licence or used to have a medical licence.  Yes guidelines need to be established as who can receive opioids and some kind of physiological evaluation needs to be accomplished before a prescription can be issued.  Again this needs to be done by the doctor prescribing the medicine. Hopefully that will identify abusers form the onset.   I'm on 270 ME daily right now, I greatly fear your proposal of reducing medicare patient's  to 90 ME daily total.  I have seen this type of policy carried out in a hospital setting and it wasn't pretty.  There was a whole floor of El camino hospital devoted to pain patients,  the nurse council decided the max dose a patient could get was 4 mg of hydromorphone in a 4 HR period.  If the patient needed more even under doctors orders, the nurses refused to give a higher dose.  They had an entire floor devoted to people who were in higher levels of pain,  it sounded like something out of a bad movie, people begging for pain relief and the nurses closing the room door to keep the cries for relief from upsetting the other patients.  I used to think the Mountain View, Ca hospital was a good facility, I have changed my opinion on that hospital.  


My case is that I'm enrolled in a UCLA reduction program,  I'm down from 358 to 270 ME'S yes it's a small reduction but so far I have given up some functionality and my overall pain level is higher.  I expect that I will have a much higher pain level before this is all said and done.  The deaths of opioid patients is a travesty.  I wonder how many were purposeful overdoses and how many were just plain stupidity drinking alcohol with a medication that directly affects their ability to breath.  Most states don't report blood alcohol level as a routine part of an post mortem examination.

"1093","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"1.  Of CMS wishes to change FDA labeling (no upper limit, no restrictions on non cancer pain) they must petition the FDA for a change.  FDA is the mandated regulatory agency for prescription drug changes.

2. According to a recent polling of 17,000 chronic pain patients, the Effective MME (EMME) for the treatment of painful disease is 0-100 milligram EMME for 30%,  100-200 for 30%, 200-400  for 15%, over 400 EMME 15%.  100 or 120 or 90 mg any cutoffs would harm 2/3 of patients with 30 or so painful disease states.  (twitter poll @thomasklinemd)

3.  Federal law 42 USC 1395 prohibits the federal government from interfering in the practice of medicine for those on medicare and medicaid.  The unanimous Linder Supreme Court ruling  sets the precedents that the issues with prescribing belong to the states not the federal government: at 268 US 5.

4.  Cancer pain is no different from another other intractable pain, ruled on by FDA 2012-P-0818.  If restrictions on the prescribing prerogatives of licensed practitioners they must apply to cancer pain as well unless studies CMS is possession of show the contrary.

5.  There is a civil rights issue for approximated one half of those with long term painful disease.  AS disabled by SSDI or the states,they automatically are in protected class.   The discrimination is clear:  ""Sorry chronic pain person, you don't have cancer can't treat you with high doses. Here are your reduced doses mandated by the federal government"".   The two drinking fountain model.

6.  The dose of the opiate is not related to addiction nor overdose deaths (FDA 2012-P-0818) although assumed by the opiophobes. 

7.  The number of days it takes to trigger an addiction is one day if you speak to people with addiction disease. Seven days, three days, 2 days, have no basis in fact short of ""do something"", an inappropriate interference with the practice of medicine that will not save a single person from overdose or death.  This started at the CDC an was admittedly opionion only not based on science.  The question arises who were the ""experts"".

8.  CDC statistics report rising ""overdose deaths"" not specifying  in whom?   The vast majority are Heroin Overdose deaths
and adjective universally left off.  Ask Leonard Paulozzi at CDC the person behind the data who exactly is dying and how many of the deaths were due soley to prescription opioids as claimed by CDC and now by the nation. 

9.  The CDC Guideline and other  CDC reports do not claim addiction is increasing, a frequent illogical jump in the evidence.

10. Heroin overdose deaths have been fairly steady since 1970. The question is: what will proposed restrictions to prescribing by  licensed medical personnel prevent what and how many>  Mean while what happens to the the 99.5% who will not addict, nor die, but will  suffer permanently from lack of pain treatment now and for future generations.  The Salem witch hanging of neighbors (20) ended when one pastor wrote:  Will we hang ten to find one witch.

12.  Prescription opioid deaths have been steady for 6 years by NIH Data (google NIH overdose deaths, revised, 2017 graph #3.) not increasing as claimed by CDC.  NIH is the prime medical advice and research agency we physicians see as the final word.

11. The right to relieve pain is clearly spelled out in the UN as a right for all people.  You cannot relieve pain by restricting dose, which is why FDA has no upper limit for dose range in chronic painful disease. 

12.  The 90 mg CDC cutoff was intended only for first opiate prescription in opiate naive patients (google Medium Houry Kline) not for chronic disease.  Even at that it was made up without scientific or logical support only ""opinion"" or ""contextual review"" the same thing.

13.  Lastly, the comment that ended another epidemic of fear and death of critical thinking was the Senator Joe McCarthy
hearings when someone spoke up and said, ""Senator do you have no shame"".

Medicare is one of the most important pillars of Puerto Rico's healthcare system, thus, the island needs adequate and equitable funding to service the healthcare needs of the more than 580,000 MA beneficiaries, among them 280,000 Dual Eligible (Medicaid & Medicare, Platinos), more than half of the dialysis patients in the island, and the majority of our elders. The funding of the MA program in Puerto Rico needs to be closer to the U.S. national average, or at least at the level of the U.S. Virgin Islands. To this effect, we fully endorse the proposals submitted by the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage Product Association (MMAPA) and the Puerto Rico Healthcare Community.
 
Taking swift and bold action now to stabilize Medicare in Puerto Rico will (1) enhance the quality of care for the most vulnerable beneficiaries, (2) motivate US residents, primary care physicians and key healthcare providers in the island to forgo additional migration to the US mainland, and (3) encourage future investment in Puerto Rico's health care system infrastructure; all of which are needed after the tragedy caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Our senior citizen were adversely affected by these hurricanes and the MA program is a key component of the recovery efforts. Many retired and senior US citizens residing in Puerto Rico look forward to enhanced healthcare services and better quality of life. There is no reason for US citizens to have one third of the funding when compared to our fellow US citizens residing in the mainland. It should reasonably be the same MA program in all US jurisdiction.

"1095","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"Anticoagulant medications (including non-warfarin oral anticoagulant, or NWOAs) are used by hundreds of thousands of people in the US and, due to the lack of prescribing and care management standards, are major contributors to  serious and avoidable adverse drug events, particularly among seniors. Also, under-utilization of anticoagulants and non-adherence are major contributors to catastrophic strokes, DVT, and pulmonary emboli. Despite their wide (and growing) utilization, their remarkable efficacy, and the risk of avoidable adverse events when not properly managed, there are NO national standards for prescribing and managing these drugs. Systems have been developed to assure safe management of lesser-used medications that have known serious side-effects (e.g. REMS) but, amazingly, no such standards exist for anticoagulant utilization.

The Pharmacy Quality Alliance has developed a robust, claims-based measure of adherence to NWOAs, but CMS has concluded that such a measure is not worthy of implementation for Medicare Managed Care and Part D plans for 2019. Given the volume of prescribing, the profound efficacy in common conditions (e.g. AF), and the devastating harm caused by mismanagement and poor adherence, the decision by CMS is perplexing, to say the very least.

In my attached letter I share my personal experience with the agents (including the premature death of my own father) and describe multiple reasons supporting the inclusion of the NWOA measure for 2019 Safety Reports. 

I urge you to reconsider your decision regarding the NWOAs, and hope that you will include the PQA measure for 2019. It is an important first step in driving national improvements in the outpatient management of this high-risk class of medications, and to delay is to perpetuate the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the current, low-quality care system.

"1096","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Suicide will ensue greatly with these ""dose restrictions"" on long term chronic pain patients!!!! Suicide has become the ""Real"" killer that is rampant now among chronic pain patients. These are usually long-time pain patients who have received a ""Stable daily dose"" of opiate medications most for many years and who all of a sudden due to new laws, restrictions, regulations, and mandates, their Doctor has suddenly cut them completely off of their opiate medication OR they were ""forced"" into a dose taper that is in and of itself alone often ""excrutiating"" for long term chronic pain patients of opiate medications. These ""Dose tapers"" cause withdrawal BOTH mentally & physically. So the ""Stable"" patient who was once well fuctioning prior to the taper has now been put into a severe and sudden whirlwind of phsyciological and physical torment along with the FACT that their pain is now left grossly under-controlled and they are facing a life of increased and often unrelenting pain along with the phsyciological changes that occur in the brain once these medications are reduced. All of these factors come into play at the same time and the patient often sees no way out, except ""Suicide"". Please note these are patients with NO history of any mental health disorder or disturbance PRIOR to their suicide. I will tell you if you implement this 90 mg MME Morphine Equivalency Threshold you will have a rampant increase of Suicide from pain patients who are in the Part D program. I dont think that is the goal here. The goal here is to ""save lives"" not have more lives ended, and efficently all this mandate will do is further reduce access to these patients needed medications. The patient who is ""compliant"" and has been on long-term opiates at a stable dose for many years but at doses greater than this mandate will allow, are the patients who will be targeted here, and who will be affected by the strict dose mandate you are trying to create in your program.These are also the same patients we are now seeing a dramatic increase in suicide rates from. This is extremely disturbing, and I fear a great deal for these patients lives should Medicare pass this dose restriction. The addiction rate for ""long term chronic pain patients"" is less than >1% as these patients have been on higher doses for many years with no signs of abberant or drug seeking behavior. If we see these sign we immediately implement a ""humane dose taper"". NOTE: It is EXTREMELY RARE in the patients who have been on high doses for many years as any ""sign"" of addiction or abberant behavior from a ""problem patient"" will usually always show within the first 6 months to 1 year following an implement of a daily opioid regimen. The patients who have been on high dose opiates for many years are not the ones we see ""addiction"" from.

Please understand the 90 mg MME Morphine Equivalency may be appropriate to implement for ""NEW opiate Naive"" patients. 

However, the harm and risk associated with implementing this kind of dose restriction on ""long term chronic intractable stable pain patients"" far outweighs the benefit. In medicine if the ""harm & risk outweigh the benefit"" we dont do it, and in this case I greatly urge you to take that simple fact into consideration.

KCP is an alliance of members of the kidney care community that serves as a forum for patient advocates, dialysis care professionals, providers, and manufacturers to advance policies that support the provision of high quality care for individuals with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).  

KCP strongly supports providing beneficiaries living with kidney failure with the ability to select the type of health insurance they believe will best meet their needs. We are pleased that all ESRD patients will have access to MA plans, which will promote coordinated care that may result in better management of kidney failure and related diseases and disorders.  It is important to ensure access to MA plans by providing them with full funding.  As described in detail below, KCP supports the dialysis-only ESRD USPCC growth percentage for CY 2019, the ESRD Normalization Factor trend, and the proposed CKD coefficient.  We are concerned, however, with the lack of guidance around calcimimetics, the recalibration of the ESRD risk adjusters, and the payment year blend of Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS) to Encounter Data System (EDS).

"1101","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"Please stop this madness.  Chronic Pain Patients are not addicts.  In the 8 years of the horrible pain of Interstitial Cystitis, Cervical Herniation, repeated Rotator Cuff tears, Lupus and Sjogren's, I have never been tempted to take more medication than I need for pain. I do not get ""high"" from opiate medication. I do get significant pain relief.  In other words, the medication I take works exactly as it is designed to work.

I do not drink, smoke, engage in risky behavior EVER, and never did anything to ""deserve"" the incurable illness and conditions that are now wreaking havoc on my body.  I have never run out of, lost, stolen, sold, diverted, nor mixed with other ""stuff"" - unlike actual addicts.  With pain medication, I can get out of my bed and be a caregiver to my husband, who has End Stage Renal Disease.  I can prepare meals.  I can drive him to his Dialysis sessions.  Without my pain medication, I can barely get from my bed to the toilet.  Without pain medication, I cannot sleep.  Without pain medication, I spend most of my day huddled in the fetal position on my bed, clutching ice packs to my private parts and my shoulders and neck, to try and numb the pain of my incurable diseases.

Why are we being punished for the failures of the few who abuse?  Does our government just want us dead?  What gives any of the people pushing this horrific agenda the right to take away the one thing that gives us a semblance of a quality of life, and make it possible for us to contribute to society?  Why is our government trying to practice medicine?

Why are addicts being treated with more deference and respect?  Addiction is now called a disease, and the people suffering from addiction are treated with kid gloves.  Yet, the millions of us with documented pain who work hand in hand with our doctors, and are doing well, are now being treated like dirty junkies.  Our medications are now being reduced and/or cut off completely, and why?  Because of Special Interests and the anti-opiate stance of organizations like PROP and Andrew Kolodny?  When did this man get so much power over millions of people?  There are 100 million Chronic Pain sufferers in this country.

I am sorry for the families who lost children who overdosed at parties, I am sorry for the families whose lives were turned inside out by junkies.  I know personally what that feels like.  I lost a brother to addiction.  That is one of the reasons I never EVER developed any bad habits, ""experimented,"" nor developed any addictions whatsoever.  Getting walloped in my 50s by horrifically painful and incurable illnesses and injury was not something I planned.  Like many chronic pain patients, I have tried Nsaids first.  They caused bleeding and intestinal and kidney damage.  Being female, and because anti-depressants are handed out like candy to women, I also tried anti-depressants.  They almost broke my brain.

I tried Biofeedback.  I tried Physical Therapy.  I tried Acupuncture.  I tried Yoga, Chanting, and thinking happy thoughts.  I tried prayer.  Still praying.  Had ANY of those treatments worked, I would never have taken any opiate medication.

Nsaids are dangerous drugs, and cause far more death than Opiates.  It boggles the mind that they are now being pushed as an effective treatment plan for chronic pain.

And in all this hand-wringing and ""fake news"" over opiates, where is the outcry against Alcoholism?  Cigarettes?  Both of which kill and maim FAR more people than opiates.

Legitimate prescriptions for pain medication are not the problem.  And you know this.  And we all know that you know this.

None of us with severe and debilitating chronic pain asked for what life has dealt to us.  But we have it anyway.  And each and every individual and members of the organizations and government who are trying to take away our medication could just as easily find themselves exactly where we are.  Life doesn't discriminate.  Incurable painful disease and accidents happen in the blink of an eye.

I am begging you to stop this madness.  We are dying.  This is a modern day genocide.  Is there anyone in power who actually cares what is happening to us?  Because in addition to being in pain, millions of chronic pain sufferers are also now terrified.  I do not recognize my own country anymore.  It used to be a place with government that actually enacted legislation that helped its people.

With the lives of millions of people at stake, you are going to be on the wrong side of history of you enact legislation that deprives us of pain medication that enables us to live.

"1106","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"   I am a 66-year-old woman who has been disabled since 1988. My insurance coverage is through Medicare and Tricare for Life. Besides receiving general care from my primary medical physician, I have been in a Pain Management program for the past eight years. Because the Pain Management center moved to another city, I was forced to find a new provider in my city. Presently and for the last four years, a doctor specializing in Neurological Disorders is treating me. 

   When I was very young I was diagnosed with Scoliosis. Thereafter I became Diabetic type I, and following numerous vehicle and falling accidents, I became a chronic pain patient diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Degenerative Disk Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis, Neuropathy with bone spurs and Migraine headaches.

   Presently my pain management doctor is seeing me through very difficult times in my life. He has presented me with a manageable living of life by strictly controlling my pain medications that consist of a 48 hour Fentanyl 75 MCG patch, Dilaudid 2 MG and Diazepam 5 MG. Taking these medications as directed has been no less then a miracle in controlling my numerous medical problems. 

   To simply now restrict my doctor's prescribed medications would subject me once again to pains that no person should have to live with. I have full faith in my pain management doctor and his prescribed medications for me.

   All medical professionals should take time in realizing some doctors are true to their oath and their patient when prescribing medications. Because some people violate the law, others should not be held responsible. Limiting these good doctors and people is the same as a jail sentence.

But now, in classic totalitarian form, the innocent will pay for the weaknesses and poor judgement of others. My own doctor treats less and less pain patients because he is terrified of the government. When I think of the pain I was once in (and I am talking writhing around unable to be still level pain) and imagine being denied pain relief because some person somewhere might abuse this life saver? I am certain that suicide would have been considered. No one who has never experienced chronic intractable pain should be legislating medical therapies for people who are.

"1115","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA," I strongly urge you to reject both the proposed changes to Medicare part D for opioids used by chronic pain patients. The government has no business dictating how much  or what types of medications can be prescribed to a patient. This should be left to the physician who is actually treating the patient on an individual basis. Often times these opioids are the last medicine of choice to treat chronic pain. Many other medications, especially NSAIDS  cause side-effects such as bleeding and that makes them unavailable to the chronic pain patient.

People are all unique and should not be treated with ""one-size fits all ""restrictions. 

 Furthermore, I urge you to reject limiting patients to a seven day supply of their medication. It will cause tremendous hardship for chronic pain patients with extra trips to the doctor's office and to the pharmacy.  Many can't drive and need to rely on family and friends for transportation. Many people will end up with lapses in their medication because of delays getting into the doctor's office or trying to get transportation so often. These trips to the doctor and pharmacy are often exhausting and will be the only thing that person can do for at least that day, maybe two or three days. 

 Please stop punishing the millions of people with chronic pain. We do not abuse our medication. We already sign contracts with our doctor and are subject to random drug tests and  pill counts just  to obtain our medication. Opioids provide people in chronic pain with just enough relief to have some quality of life to do things like go to the grocery store, cook a meal, and go to church.

The real problem is with the Fentanyl and Heroin that is illegally coming in from China and Mexico and the addicts that are using those drugs. These proposed changes will do nothing to stop them. The government needs to focus on efforts there and not to control people's medication.

 Continued restrictions on opioids for chronic pain control  is inhumane. Many patients will be forced into disability. Others will become bedridden and have severely  diminished quality of life. The end result will be a tremendous increase in the number of suicides.  A lifetime of pain without relief is no life at all.

Please reject these proposed changes and leave the decisions for patient care and treatment to the doctors who know their patients.  Thank you!

"1122","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA," I have Lupus and MS. And chronic pain. These diseases have ruined my life. The only solace I have is that opioid pain medication makes it bearable and allow me to have some quality of life. 

Before opioid pain meds I tried COUNTLESS other treatments including Neurontin, Lyrica, 800mg Motrin. I tried physical therapy. I was even on antidepressants. But nothing helped. 

I have taken opioids responsibly for 10 years. And now I am terrified that the only thing that's allowed me to lead somewhat of a normal life is going to be greatly reduced or taken away. All because other people abuse them.

I can assure you that people like me who are in too much pain to get out of bed or go to the bathroom unassisted without this medcation, are not selling them. But yet we are being punished because other people want to get high.

I agree that addiction is a disease and I have compassion for people who struggle with it. But unlike addiction, my diseases can't be helped with a stint in rehab and a little willpower. And when you eliminate or drastically reduce the only thing that helps chronic pain patients, the addicts will find another way to get high. And the rest of us will be left to suffer. 

When trying to determine if stricter regulation is warranted, please look at the whole picture. Talk to chronic pain patients and their treating physicians, not just those who have lost a loved one to addiction or people who have no idea what it's like to live every minute of every day in excruciating, relentless pain.

"1124","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"In 1991,at the age of 29, I was working for Johnson & Johnson as a pharmaceutical sales representative. I was electrocuted in the flooded basement of my parent's house. I suffered many physical injuries, but the most devastating damage occurred in my brain. I have damage to the right frontal lobe, several nerves that were destroyed by the electricity, and now have abnormal white matter as a result of the accident which makes me susceptible to Early Onset Dementia. I have been diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD. The worst problem that I've lived with for 27 years is severe, chronic head pain. I spent several years searching for a cure at top medical facilities throughout the country, including Emory U. Hospital in Atlanta, GA, Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL, and the U. of Chicago hospital where I participated in the largest study ever conducted on electrical injuries (""Electrical Trauma Research Program"") in 1994. When the Chicago doctors told me that my condition may end in a week or may never end, that's when I knew what the rest of my life would be like.

In addition, I've had four operations on my right knee, resulting in moderate - to - severe osteoarthritis and a knee replacement when I cannot handle the pain any longer. I've ruptured two lumbar discs, both requiring surgery. When I spend more than a couple of days in bed with my severe head pain, my back becomes very stiff and painful. I've spent many days and nights on the bedroom floor. I also broke a bone in my left wrist several times, requiring three surgeries. I have severe osteoarthritis here, too. Ultimately, a fusion of the wrist was the result. 

I have tried every treatment: acupuncture, hypnosis, deep tissue massage, physical therapy, biofeedback and relaxation techniques. I have been prescribed medications for high blood pressure, anti-seizure, anti-depressants, migraines. I've also been prescribed every type of pain medication that I'm aware of. Some doctors gave me far too many pills (back in the 1990's) after I told them the pills weren't working. Untold amounts were flushed down the toilet, before I learned how to properly dispose of them. 

I found a Pain Management Specialist in 2002. He doesn't like prescribing pills, because he thinks severe pain sufferers may take too many to try to eliminate the pain, risking overdose. So I have been using the fentanyl patch 16 years. It took a couple of years to find the right combination, but once it was found, I received the best pain relief since the accident in 1991. I still have pain, and I sometimes have pain levels that reach 9-10 on the 0-10 pain scale. But this medicine keeps my pain at a level that allows me to be alive.

If my current medication, which is far above the levels proposed, were to be taken away, I would not survive. I am not being dramatic. And I am not making a false statement. I CAN NOT survive the pain I have without the fentanyl patches to provide me with relief.  I cannot imagine committing suicide, but I had a friend who did because he couldn't live with his severe pain any longer. And if my medication is taken away, I already know how severe my pain will be because I have lived with it before. If I am forced to do something drastic because of these ill-conceived, uninformed and draconian measures proposed by CMS and enforced by an insurance company's bottom line, CMS will be solely responsible for the outcome. 

Please don't take my medications away! I don't have much of a life, especially compared to what it was before my accident, but I do have family and loved ones that I am able to spend time with now. Without my medications, I won't be able to spend much, if any, time with anyone. That, too, will contribute to the end of my life. What's sad is that there are so many others who suffer as much or more than me. These absurd CMS propositions will destroy millions of lives.

"1126","CMS",FALSE,1,NA,NA,"CMS unlawfully proposes to interfere with patients whose doctors treat us for pain, by compelling doctors not to exceed an arbitrary dosage limit, that was arbitrarily and capriciously set by a lobbying group called PROP, who lobbied the Centers for Disease Control to allow PROP to publish a rationale for the arbitrary dosage limit on CDC stationery. CMS must halt this unlawful action or I and other consumers will litigate.

The Medicare Act prohibits Medicare from interfering in how treatment is prescribed or performed.  Medicare may reimburse treatments or refuse to reimburse treatments.  It may not order treatments to be withheld.

The proposed Part D Payment Policies go far beyond that legal authority, allowing an insurer to command a pharmacy not to fill a prescription, if the insurer believes the prescription will exceed the arbitrary PROP standard.  I object to this policy as Count I and will sue to have it overturned if CMS adopts it.

Count II of my lawsuit will consist of the arbitrary and capricious nature of the PROP daily limitation of ""90 milligrams morphine equivalent"" (MMEQ) for pain treatment, on the grounds of it being arbitrary, capricious, and a taking of the Fourth Amendment rights of each person to be secure in his person and effects, without due process of law.  That taking arises, because the PROP standard, which CDC adopted as a Guideline and CMS proposes to turn into a Regulation, makes three demonstrably-false assumptions about human opioid metabolism.  The three false assumptions are that every person's enzymes for metabolizing opioids are identical (they're not), that every person's response to all opioids can be quantified by a scheme PROP proposed for defining the ""equivalency of opioids to morphine"" (the scheme is dangerously flawed), and that the normal human body contains no opioids (30 years of Government research proves that humans manufacture morphine in our red blood cells, a fact of which PROP was actually aware at the time it lied to the public and to CDC).  Imposing PROP's 90 MMEQ standard, in the absence of medical evidence supporting it, is a taking of the right to be secure in one's person and one's effects.

Count III of my lawsuit will not be against CMS, as it will apply to the various corporate co-defendants who financed PROP and advanced the PROP scheme at CDC by gifts of money that facially seem to have served the same purpose as would an unlawful bribe.

Since CMS may be ignorant of the reasoning behind Count II of my planned lawsuit, I'm attaching a recent research paper I sent the Food and Drug Administration, reminding them of what 30 years of federally-funded research on opioids actually proved.

"1130","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I have severe chronic pain from fibromyalgia, arthritis, and hypermobility that causes my joints to partially dislocate easily. I am extremely concerned about the impact on patients such as myself and others who are only able to maintain an independent state of living and achieve some quality of life by having their pain treated appropriately. 

There are no scientific studies that support the idea that patients with chronic pain are likely to misuse their medication or become addicted to it. There are, however, studies that show that patients with chronic pain are not likely to experience addiction or misuse. Statistics show that most people who experience opioid addiction and abuse are not acquiring it through prescriptions or while under the care of a doctor. Instead, they are typically acquiring the drugs illegally. A person who is a heroin addict is not the same as a person who has a prescription they use according their doctor's instructions.

I believe that refusing to treat chronic pain patients with medication that alleviates the severity of their pain will cause many more people to become disabled or need to go into nursing homes because they will be unable to bathe and feed themselves, clean their homes, do their laundry, etc. That will be much more expensive in the long run than allowing patients to have the medicine they need to look after themselves. 

When someone is in severe pain and it is not alleviated by any medication, severe depression tends to set in. When a person cannot take care of themselves or do anything that brings joy to their lives -- cannot go for walks, attend church, garden or practice hobbies, or even focus on things enough to read books because the pain is so bad -- they feel there is nothing to live for, and many people become suicidal. All they want is for the pain to decrease enough to allow them a dignified human life, and when doctors will not help them, they feel like they have no choice but to end their lives. 

For the past eleven years, I have experienced approximately the same level of pain. My medication has never increased in dosage. Treated, instead of my pain being 10/10, it becomes 6 or 7 out of 10. It never goes away, and I've had to stop working and stop most of my hobbies, but I can at least take care of myself, attend church, and read. Without my medicine, I can hardly move because all of my joints feel like they're lined with glass and my hands hurt so badly that I cry when I try to wash my hair, open cans, cut food, button my clothes, tie my shoes, carry or lift anything, etc. Using my cane or walker is almost impossible because I have to lean weight on my hands to use them properly, and that is excruciating.

I have had kidney stones many times, including one that was larger than 10mm and required multiple surgeries to remove and I spent a week and a half in the hospital with sepsis related to it. I have broken three bones, one of which needed a plate and six screws to reassemble. I've had other major surgery, as well, and I've been in two bad car accidents. My idea of a ""10"" as far as pain is not stubbing my toe or bumping my head. My ""10"" is being unable to think clearly or move because everything hurts so badly. It is having a difficult time speaking lucidly. It is a hazy hell where time passes but I am unable to interact with anyone or the world, like I am in a prison, and that prison is my own body. 

This is what you would be condemning me and many others to, constantly. Every day of the rest of their lives, which will likely be dramatically shortened, between the stress severe unabated pain causes and the depression brought on by having constant pain and being unable to do anything anymore. That kind of nightmare is something no one should be forced to endure. It is torture and cruelty. 

Do not do this.

On behalf of 130 New York adult day health care (ADHC) providers and the families they serve, the Adult Day Health Care Council (ADHCC) commends CMS for its proposal to expand the scope of the primarily health related supplemental benefit standard (pp. 182-183) to benefits that enhance beneficiaries' quality of life and improve health outcomes. We believe adult day health care meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance to include ADHC in plan offerings.  

Adult day health care, licensed and certified by the New York State Department of Health, is designed to meet the needs of chronically ill, frail elderly and disabled adults who require primary, preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic rehabilitative or palliative services. Services provided in every ADHC program in New York State include: skilled nursing care, pharmaceutical services, clinical and case management, medical and diagnostic care, social, therapeutic and recreational programs, rehabilitative and maintenance therapies, personal care and dietary services. Participants have all of their health care needs assessed and met (or arranged for) by the program. This comprehensive, integrated care leads to stabilization of chronic health conditions and reduced incidence of physician and emergency room visits. 

Across New York State and the nation, ADHC participants experience reductions of avoidable hospitalizations and delayed nursing home placement. A study by the New York State Department of Health credited the continuous health monitoring and health education provided in medical model adult day programs, with the findings that 70 percent of participants with multiple chronic conditions had no hospitalizations over the course of a 12-month period. A study conducted by the Adult Day Health Care Council found that 1,000 participants with five or more chronic conditions had less than one-fifth of the hospitalization rates round in the similarly situated Medicare population. 

ADHC services must be ordered by the participant's primary care physician prior to admission. The community physician will renew orders every six months if ADHC continues to be medically appropriate. ADHC services are provided at a per-diem rate, which is much lower, and has more benefit, than providing individual services in the home. Simply being in the center provides a safe, supervised and socially stimulating environment which reduces chronic isolation often experienced by older adults and supports the overall physical, cognitive and mental health of the beneficiary.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on CMS-2017-0163. We strongly encourage CMS to recognize ADHC as one of the expanded health-related supplemental benefits to be included in Medicare Advantage Plans during the bidding process.

We believe adult day services meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance to include ADS in plan offerings.

The primary purpose of adult day services is to reduce avoidable and emergency healthcare utilization by providing person-centered, comprehensive maintenance and skilled services up to seven days per week, 12 hours per day, in a supervised, congregated setting. Adult day services generally fall into two models, social adult day care (SADC) and adult day health care (ADHC). SADC services include supervision, socialization, healthy and nutritious meals, therapeutic activities and some or total assistance with personal care. ADHC models further provide skilled nursing, medication management, personal care, and therapeutic activities. Some centers also provide restorative and maintenance physical, occupational, and speech therapies, psychological and dietary counseling services. Most centers provide transportation, social work and care management services to ameliorate functional and psychological impact of injuries or chronic health conditions. These services are generally provided at a per-diem rate, which is much lower, and has more benefit, than providing individual services in the home. Simply being in the center provides a safe, supervised and socially stimulating environment which reduces chronic isolation often experienced by older adults and supports the overall physical, cognitive and mental health of the beneficiary.

"1147","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"This legislation is beyond inhumane to the chronic and intractable pain patient community. This will negatively affect many with chronic pain and vast majority of those with 24/7 intractable pain by not being allowed the humane medical treatment we deserve. We are not drug abusers and we should in no way be put in the same group with people who choose to behave illegally. Since when has our government been required to obtain medical degrees that make them more knowledgeable in treating chronic and intractable pain patients than the doctors who do specialize in it? Intractable pain that millions of people in America suffer from, will severely damage your body and lead to death if their pain is not properly reduced. This is not new information but suddenly no one in our government understands or cares about that fact? If our government was medically qualified enough to advise our medical professionals & impose restrictions on how our subpopulation is treated than they would understand how much medical harm will come to patients like myself should this pass. One must reason, if the dangers of high pain leading to more physical damage is known, then the intent behind causing such harm to millions of these Americans is purposeful. Why would our government cause such cruelty? Are we thought of as having such little value in society from those we elected, that they think it is best we all just die off from the intractable pain that will eventually kill us if not treated properly as I mentioned above? Maybe the goal is that many of us will die off from suicide? If our government truly does understand what intractable pain does to those who suffer from it, they know this will happen as there is no way someone will be able to continue living in such horrid pain 24/7 without the proper pain medication dose that allows them to somewhat function. I have never wished my rare medical conditions on anyone, but it is time for our government to really understand what it is like to experience intractable pain cause apparently no one currently pushing for this inhumane legislation does. It is not difficult to find legitimate reasons someone suffering from intractable pain would need high dose opioids. Listen to the pain specialists that do have knowledge of the irrefutable science behind why intractable pain patients may need high dose opioids. These specialists are trying to teach our government the reason why. Yet these committed and true to their profession pain specialists are not thanked or valued for their scientifically correct teaching or knowledge, instead they are persecuted by the DEA. The most disturbing part for these doctors/specialists is that this persecution comes for them as a result of implementing their accurate medical knowledge and for refusing to abandon their hippocratic oath to first do no harm to their patients by properly treating with high dose opioids when scientific evidence shows without a doubt, there is a strong medical need to do so. This is beyond disturbing! It should be common knowledge that patient treatment must be individualized for each patient solely. There is absolutely no one size fits all treatment for any condition or ailment medically. How is this fact that can be proven scientifically, not understood by our government? Medical treatment has to be specific to each patient and depending on the patients genetics, drug metabolism efficacy, and other conditions they have which may stop or interfere significantly with the patients absorption of needed medications. This is the exact reason why intractable pain patients may need high dose pain opioids.  The need for these high dose pain medications can be proven by doing simple lab tests, doing drug metabolism DNA testing, thorough physical exams, and analyzing imaging (i.e., CT scans, MRIs, x-rays). Why not push for further education in regards to teaching medical professionals how to accurately and scientifically evaluate their chronic and intractable pain patients' need for getting their pain under control enough to reduce further serious physical damage and prescribe opioid doses based on this individual need instead of legislation? Please do not turn a blind eye to the millions of people this inhumane legislation will affect, one day it could involve the treatment you or your loved ones can receive. Passing this legislation will lead to millions of Americans being medically neglected. Listen to the pain specialists qualified to make these decisions. Our pain specialists with proper medical degrees and experience are able to scientifically determine what dose of pain medication each patient needs, government officials are not qualified in any way to make medical decisions.

"1148","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"My name is Michael Conlin, and I am the father of a young woman who has suffered from severe intractable pain as the result of Ehlers-Danlos Hypermobility Syndrome and Adhesive Arachnoiditis for over two decades. I am writing today in opposition to the proposed change in rules for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in 2019 that would implement hard formulary-level cumulative opioid safety edits at 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME).

If implemented, this ""one-size-fits-all"" proposal will effectively deny reliable, individualized pain treatment to millions of Medicare beneficiaries (Chronic pain is the number one disability in America today), many of whom are seniors, poor, or disabled individuals who rely on opioid medications to: manage excruciating and incurable pain; allow for increased function and productivity; and maintain a tolerable quality of life. If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses at 90 MME per day, it will give ""Sponsors"" (private insurance companies) an excuse to stop paying for necessary prescriptions and pharmacies freedom from dispensing them at all, while stigmatizing pain patients and treating them like criminals.

The consequences of this policy, whether intended or unintended, will predictably: drive even more doctors away from humane treatment of pain out of fear of reprisal, leading to ""doctor dumping"" of highly vulnerable pain patients with no place else to turn; reduce not only accessibility to pain specialists, but to legal medications to combat intractable pain; force more patients from functionality into disability at great social cost by decreasing national productivity and raising medical costs; lead to increased use of illegal street drugs to deal with pain, resulting in increased deaths due to overdose from drug naivety, unregulated dosages, and  tainted product; and, when the medical establishment is perceived as unwilling or unable to meet basic patient needs, lead to an increase in patient suicides. 

The assumption that establishing a hard formulary will reduce addiction and overdose deaths is not supported by reliable science.  In the case of patients with intractable, non-cancer pain, a review of international medical research by the Cochrane Library found that treatment with long term, high dose opioids produced addiction rates of less than 1 percent. 

In 2016, the CDC issued guidelines for opioid prescription that were based on the similar track of logic: that if physicians were more restrained in their prescribing, fewer of their patients would become addicted, and the pathway to painkiller addiction and ultimately to street heroin and fentanyl would run dry. If proven valid, the expected outcome would have witnessed a decrease in overdoses and opioid deaths, but while opioid prescriptions have deceased by over 48 percent since 2010 to a ten-year low, overdose deaths during that same time frame have increased by over 10% to a 10 ten year high. While CDC logic has proven to be flawed, anti-opioid groups such as PROP are attempting to convert the voluntary CDC guidelines into legislation, building on the same flawed logic with predictable end results.

There is a subset of patients who will always be vulnerable to abusing their prescription medications. Taking opioids away from legitimate chronic or intractable pain patients will not resolve the underlying individual vulnerabilities or societal triggers of addiction, but the collateral damage inflicted on pain sufferers will be severe. Intractable pain patients are not drug addicts, their use of opioids is legal, but they are being punished, deprived of life saving medications because of the illegal actions of those who would abuse medications with full knowledge of the potentially fatal consequences. 

Over and over, pain patients have heard the caveat that proposed guidelines and regulations are not intended to take opioids away from legitimate chronic pain patients. Nice rhetoric that provides political cover, but as pain sufferers will attest, that is exactly what is happening, and will continue to happen if the CMS hard formulary of 90 MME is adopted. 

Transferring pharmacological decisions from a trained medical practitioner to the hands of a ""Sponsor"" (private insurers who can increase their profitability by denying costly medications) is inherently flawed and comes at the expense of the estimated 1.6 million intractable pain patients currently dependent on high dose opioid protocols.

I implore you to seek solutions that don't impose cruel and unusual punishment on pain sufferers through implementation of formulary solutions that ignore the importance of individualized care from qualified medical practitioners in favor of formulas based on questionable logic that provide expanded market opportunities for illegal drug dealers and protection for insurance companies, not patients. Please do not impose the 90 MME formulary.

INTRODUCTION

I am the Medical Director for Palliative & Supportive Care at Orlando Health UF Health Cancer Center (OH-UFHCC). I serve on the Board of the American Academy of Hospice & Palliative Medicine (AAHPM). I chair the American Medical Association (AMA) Pain & Palliative Medicine Specialty Section Council and have served on the AMA's Opioid Task Force for the last 3 years. I have served on the Editorial Board for the Journal of Pain & Symptom Management since 2009. As a physician practicing outpatient palliative care for over 17 years, I am very concerned that CMS's proposed rule changes for opioid prescribing will severely impair my patients' quality of life.

90 MORPHINE MILLIGRAM EQUIVALENT (MME) LIMIT

Clinical Concerns

My patients suffer from severe cancer pain; their analgesic dosing is highly individualized and many require higher doses than 90 MME to achieve control of their cancer pain within accepted standards for palliative care. Adoption of a 90 MME limit will prevent many from achieving sufficient control of their cancer pain.

About 73% of cancer outpatients report difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions, half of these due to delays from requests for prior authorization [Kollas CD, Boyer-Kollas B. J Pain Sympt. Management, Feb 2018;55(2):663-4]. CMS directs sponsors to ""continue to apply specifications to account for known exceptions, such as hospice care; cancer diagnoses,"" but is unclear if exceptions will apply to cases ""previously determined to be medically necessary"" or if additional determination will be required. CMS should create an explicit exception or exemption to specify that an opioid is being prescribed ""for the treatment of cancer-related pain"" or ""for a patient enrolled in hospice care"" to prevent further delays in treatment for vulnerable patients.

Health Policy Concerns

CMS improperly legitimizes a 90 MME per day limit for opioids, which lacks an accepted scientific basis. The CDC Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain mysteriously included this limit after the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) rejected it via an unsolicited petition by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, PROP (Ballantyne JC, et al. 2012). Notably, PROP included no experts in hospice and palliative care 

CDC's inclusion of the 90 MME limit into the CDC Guidelines led to criticism from the AMA and AAHPM for a lack of transparency (Anson P. Pain News Network, Sept. 21, 2015), leading to a second open comment period. Ultimately, CDC exempted vulnerable populations, such as those receiving hospice and/or palliative care, who often require opioid doses exceeding the 90 MME limit. Including the 90 MME limit from the CDC Guidelines would mistakenly grant credibility to a false concept of an objective opioid limit. 


STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ABOUT FLAGS FOR GABAPENTIN AND PREGABALIN	

Efficacy & Off-Label Usage

Gabapentin is useful in treating cancer pain adjuvantly or alternatively to opioids. CMS proposes ""additional flags for high risk beneficiaries who use ""potentiator"" drugs (such as gabapentin and pregabalin) in combination with prescription opioids,"" citing ""increasing use of gabapentin for off-label indications, despite the lack of evidence from clinical trials,"" and that ""gabapentin is FDA-approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and the treatment of partial onset seizures."" Gabapentin is useful in treating neuropathic cancer pain and scientific evidence supports its off-label use: ""Gabapentin provides pain relief of a high level in about a third of people who take it for painful neuropathic pain"" [Moore RA et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rvw. 2014 April 27;(4);CD007938] and ""oxycodone/naloxone added to pregabalin or gabapentin provided additional relief and symptom control... without clinically significant safety concerns"" (Kim BS, et al. Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Dec 27. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12822).

Overuse

I have experienced only one case of overuse of gabapentin to relieve cancer-related pain in the last 17 years, corrected after an informed discussion about proper dosing. I have never experienced diversion involving gabapentin or pregabalin.

7-DAY LIMIT ON OPIOIDS FOR INITIAL FILLS

I am least concerned about a 7-day supply limit for ""initial fills of prescription opioids for the treatment of acute pain."" To avoid confusion, I strongly recommend that CMS add clear language that exempts patients with cancer-related pain or patients receiving hospice care from the 7-day supply limit for opioid prescriptions.	

CONCLUSION

I am very concerned that the CMS Proposed Opioid Rules will have negative consequences for many cancer patients. I recommend eliminating a 90 MME per day limit, which lacks a basis in science, and I urge CMS to create an explicit exemption for patients receiving hospice care or treatment of cancer-related pain to mitigate potential harm from these proposed rules.

If someone is seeing a pain specialist they should be exempt from this limit.  I can see limits for injuries that wouldn't need opioids long term.  Most folks who see a pain specialist have regular drug testing and also see a psychiatrist.  There are precautions In place so folks don't become addicted. The people with the addiction issue to opioids are those who steal it from those who need it or come up with other ways. If an addict wants these drugs they will find away.  Years ago Marijuana was a huge issue and now it is legal for medical uses in many states.  That is an illegal drug, My prescribed Opioid medications are not illegal or gotten by illegal means.  Please consider provisions that would protect those of us who need these medications to survive.  Having provisions you will have a lot more people becoming disabled because they won't be able to work or even get out of bed!  The system is already horrible to even get on disability (I have been dealing with trying to get approval for 3.5 years!). I can just imagine the amount of new claims because you prevented people's life line.  To be honest I feel you will have a HUGE increase in suicides cause people are in so much pain they would rather die then live like they are. Insurance companies should not have a day.  If a specialist say someone needs something it should be provided. You are NOT physicians and therefore should have zero say in my medical care.  Further more there is HIPPA laws that would be violated by you getting directly involved in my care.  Something are not your business.  Your business is paying the bills, NOT directing my care or telling a doctor how to do their job or what they can or can't give us for treatment.

I have been diagnosed with axonal neuropathy, inflammatory myopathy, osteopenia and psoriasis along with other health conditions. I have been permanently disabled and receiving SSA disability for decades and have Medicare. I have tried literally hundreds of prescription medications to manage my chronic, constant, all over body pain and other symptoms that feels like thousands of needles pricking my skin, my muscles being on fire, difficulty controlling my body tempurature (sweats while I'm shaking because I'm freezing cold), muscle atrophy, etc. as well as many types of physical therapy, chiropractic, accupuncture, laser therapy, nutritional solutions, Functional Medicine, supplements, energy work...the list goes on and on but the only thing that allows me to function on any level is opioid medication. It is absolutely necessary for my life even though I so wish it wasn't. It allows me to go from absolutely horrendous pain every morning to a level where most people would describe it as miserable, and on really good days I feel what would be called lousy. The best I ever get is lousy and that's because I have access to opioids. With them, I can usually care for myself, get to my appointments, do a few errands and, on good days, cook and care for my family. Without opioids, I have no life - laying in bed in the fetal position crying uncontrollably. Please stop your attack on chronic pain patients. We are not abusing our medications. I've taken mine responsibly for decades. A simple urine test will tell you who is taking their meds responsibly and who isn't, and my pain management specialist tests me often and there is never a problem. PLEASE STOP HAVING CMS ENFORCE A HARD LIMIT ON OPIOID DOSES PER DAY. Every patient is different in how they metabolize medications, how long they've been on them, what type of pain they have, etc. Limits on opioids is giving insurance companies reasons to deny prescriptions or require preauthorizations which are time consuming, costly to patients, and often rejected. These policies leave pain management specialists afraid for their livelihoods and licenses so they end up prescribing which isn't in the best interest of their patients. Patients who can work will be forced to stop and go on disabilty and possibly Medicaid, and patients who can't work because their pain is so severe will be forced to stop functioning on any level. Patients are already committing suicide when they are tapered or denied their meds. This madness has to stop. I myself am spending more time feeling miserable and unable to function since I've been tapered on my medications, and it has just started. BTW, there is no reliable scientific data that I or my doctor know of to suggest that these limits will save any lives or stop overdoses. You have my life and many others in your hands. Please stop making my life worse than it already is.

This has never been based on any scientific data to prove that doses greater than >90 mg MME are less effective for pain or not beneficial to the patient. When it comes to dosing with opiates there is no one number you can deem as the ""safe"" number of Mg's. Opiates do not work in this way. It is impossible to say every beneficiary in Part D Medicare must be at this Mg dose or it wont be covered. The utter chaos something such as this proposal would cause is alarming to say the least. This will undoubtedly cause suffering to the beneficiaries along with Forced dose tapers that as we now are seeing hasn't done anything to stop the number of overdose deaths but it has caused increased ""suicide"" in the pain population. It is being found now that the majority of overdose deaths we are seeing is from illicit Fentanyl, and illegal heroin. Pain patients are not the ones dying of overdoses. It is very rare that a legitimate pain patient who has been on doses greater than >90 Mg MME will ever die of an actual overdose and if they do it is almost always contributed to the fact they combined benzodiazepines and opiates together or another substance. Prescription opiates are very, very rarely ever the cause of a ""true drug overdose"" this is based on actual scientific data and facts. We have undoubtedly caused a very bad stigma surrounding legitimate pain patients.These people are not criminals. Doctor's & Pain specialists, etc.. do not have time to be on the phone with the insurance company trying to get the prescription that was wrote for their patient to be approved multiple times a day, for multiple patients a day this is absolutely absurd. If passed this will without any doubt leave many, many patients on forced dose tapers and many Doctors to just abandon these patients at once causing unbelievable inhumane treatment and suffering to these people. Mandating a dosage restriction in Medicare Part D will not solve anything, nor will it stop the overdose deaths from opioids. This will have dire implications for these patients, it will ""backfire"" if this dosing mandate is passed.

Having been on pain management since 1994, starting at the bottom tier of medications, trying various medications and a whole lot of procedures till finding something that works. I was maintained on 75 mcgs every 48 hrs for many, many years. Eventually AETNA would no longer pay for this so my doctor changed me over to methadone. Since methadone has cardiac implications I had to have a yearly EKG. Add to this 6-8 drug screens yearly. I have never ""craved, desired, or hunted"" for drugs or abused the ones I was ordered. I have chronic pain from scoliosis and DDD, SPONDYLOSIS, and sciatica along with osteopenia thanks to genetics. I also have IBS with chronic uncontrolled diarrehea. My surgeon, after my reanastomosis of my small bowel, plus a month stay in hospital settled on codeine 30mgs 4 times a day with lomotil 3 times a day. All was going okay until the CDC in their rush to judgement placed severe limitations on my life. While I could work for a long while the ""SUGGESTIONS by the CDC and Dr. K caused me to apply for disability which I got due to the addition of my final GI surgery. Then in 2008 the pain medications,(90mgs methadone daily) were being cut back by my pain management doctor after every procedure I had. The codeine was cut back to 15 mgs 3 times a day, then just cut off. If you do not have IBS, which prior to this was called short bowel syndrome, and had to be more or less homebound because now, without the codeine to help, the lomotil did nothing. So in 2017, I moved from Michigan, where I was getting only 30mgs methadone daily with a wait a year to see if the procedures worked. Really, 1 year? When I arrived in Virginia, I had the usual 1 month script so I could find new pain management plus a doctor. Found a doctor but pain management everywhere I called or the 1 place I went would not even touch me because I did not want more of the same expensive procedures which never, ever worked. I needed not only my methadone, which I don't like because there is cardiac history in my family. I had no problem with my 75 mcgs every 48 hrs and certainly constipation was never going to be an issue for me. But here I am with medicare and Medicaid an champ va and zero, nada, nothing for pain. I can't leave home unless I do not eat prior to me planning to leave home the next day for grocery shopping an it is a struggle at best. Because of the pain plus weakness from not being able to eat it takes me 3 hours to shop. While back in the day I could work, but with the IBS+PAIN, none of it being controlled well, disability was granted in Michigan an when I turned 62 they made me take retirement so I did not get my full share. Never the less, I was hoping to enjoy at times this forced upon early retirement. I was going to get back into painting, long a love an was at one time my major in college. I was both a teacher and an RN, enjoying life. Now, I am in misery just trying to take care of my profoundly disabled adult daughter with an IQ of a 9 month.  I also have pets an a significant other I try to care for but it is not going well. Wirhout the medications that I needed to be able to have some quality of life and some control over pain an diarrhea I now find myself 1 year later thinking I might have to put my daughter in a home which is something I never wanted to do. Give away my pets who provide some support an happiness an tell my significant other to hire an aide. I can't leave home for anything other than food, I can't sleep, not really hungry anymore, I'm losing weight, now 5'3"", 92 lbs. I also dread each day because the pain is 24/7, the diarrhea 24/7 and living in misery and hopelessness is not a ""quality of life"", it's a ""life without quality.""

From November 2010 until April 2013 I had episodes of being curled up in a ball, shaking, teeth chattering, barely able to breathe and vomiting I had such pain!

 My medical care will be greatly damaged by your regulation. I rely upon opioid medications to manage my incurable pain. And with my diagnoses I'd be terrified to have future surgeries due to my body's incurable response to pain.   Without this medication I will be not be able to live in the pain I had been in and do what little I am able with the meds. It would take away what I have and make me more dependable on my husband. It would take away my ability to even go to my kids. Which is pretty much the only place I go because I can lay on the floor as my spine nerves demand every hour or so. Nor would I be able to play with my grandkids as little as I now do. I've so low function that it'd push me to near zero, as prior to being put on palliative care.
   If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day, this will give private insurance companies and pharmacies  an excuse to stop paying for my necessary prescriptions or dispensing them at all. 
 The proposed regulations are unsupported by any reliable science...as I am sure many are intelligent enough to know with little research.many have been trying to tell you all.
   If enacted, these policies willForce even more doctors away from treating pain. It's hard enough t get proper care already. Many are already suffering due to bad care or not able to get care, as well as treated as drug seekers when just want help.

Pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms among elderly. In U.S.A.,chronic pain is estimated affects millions each year,   Yet, it's known under reporting of pain is frequent, especially in older people & as a consequence physicians tend to under-treat pain in this group, especially pain from nonmalignant causes such as osteoarthritis(OA)& joint pain, but also cancer-related pain.
Studies suggest there are some age-related differences in the perception of & response to pain. The response to mild pain is reduced in many individuals, but elderly may be more sensitive to severe pain. The increase in pain threshold could lead to delays in diagnosis and poor recovery, while the decreased tolerance to severe pain presents management problems. In addition, under prescribing of opioids to the elderly contributes to poor pain management.

Studies comparing the efficacy & tolerability of opioids such as fentanyl patches, morphine,& sublingual Buprenorphine in  the elderly & other populations show the elderly respond, as well as,or even better, to opioid treatment than younger age  groups.
Treatment for up to 6 years with moderate doses up to 195 mg/day morphine or its equivalent has been reported 164 & even up to 360 mg & 2 g/day Cognitive function is relatively unaffected in patients taking stable moderate doses. Without problems with addiction or abuse.

World Health Organization step III opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment for cancer patients & morphine has
been the most commonly used for decades. In general, high level evidence data exist, although many studies have included only few patients. Based on these studies, all opioids are considered effective in cancer pain management
The use of opioids in noncancer-related pain: Evidence is growing opioids are efficacious in non cancer pain treatment data mostly level, but need individual dose titration & consideration of the respective tolerability profiles, it can be concluded opioids show efficacy in non-cancer pain, which is often due to diseases typical for an elderly population. Evidence based medicine,has been incorporated into best clinical practice guidelines,should serve as a foundation for decision-making processes in patient care; however in practice, the art of medicine is realized when we individualize care to the patient. This strikes a balance between evidence-based medicine & anecdotal experience. Factual recommendations & expert opinion both have value when applying guidelines in clinical practice. 
The role of opioids in neuropathic pain has been under debate in the past but is nowadays more & more accepted; however, higher opioid doses are often needed for neuropathic pain than for nociceptive pain. Most of the treatment data are level II or III, & suggest that incorporation of opioids earlier on might be beneficial. 

""A review of 24 papers by Fishbain et al.,showed addictive behavior was not common in the general chronic pain population & examples from postoperative pain studies indicate addiction is almost nonexistent. In addition, Quay & Evans both reported the medical use of opioids does not create ""street addicts"". In summary, many clinical studies have shown long-term opioid therapy can be maintained without escalation of dose or tolerance to effect presenting. Such confidence in opioid therapy should be purveyed to both nonspecialist professionals & the general public.""","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0093","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-02-20T00:00:00-05:00","Anonymous-CA"
"1171","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a pain patient diagnosed with degenerative disc disease (cervical and lumbar), spinal stenosis, numerous disc herniations, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, thoracic outlet syndrome, and RSD for more than 15 years. Throughout the years I have had many surgeries, physical therapy, accupressure, TENS units, a spinal cord stimulator that was rejected by my body and caused a massive infection, many steriod injections, as well as many radial frequency ablations. All to no avail. I spend most of my time on a heating pad. I've also tried non-opioid medications such as Cymbala, Lyrica, Neurontin, Topamax, Tramadol and Ibuprofen. I am unable to take Acetaminophen due to NASH (non-alcholic steotohepatitis). All of these medications failed to heal/help or adequately control my pain, so I require opioid pain medications. Opioids help me by managing my pain and allowing me to live a semi-normal life. I'm able to get out of bed each day and visit with my children and grandchildren. They allow me to cook meals for me and my husband and keep up with the minor chores in our household. If Medicare refuses to pay and if I do not have access to my medication over 90 MME, my life will change drastically to the point that I will spend most of my time in bed. I will be unable to do the simple chores that I now do. Life is hard enough with the constant pain. However, the opioid pain medication allows me to live as close to a normal life as is possible in my condition. I am a model pain patient. I see my pain management doctor monthly. I use the same pharmacy for all of my medications. I have regular urine drug tests. I do not partake in alcohol or cannabis. I keep my medications locked in a secure lockbox at all times. Unfortunately, my condition will only deteriorate as I get older. Pain management and opioids are my only chance of a somewhat ""normal"" life. I am disabled, NOT over 65. My medical care and decision making should be left to my doctor, who understands my complicated and complex case, not CMS/Medicare. Chronic pain sufferers should NOT have to live in constant fear of having our medication taken away from us! Prescribing has been going down for over 5 years while ODs to illicit heroin/Fentanyl coming in from Mexico/China is skyrocketing - deaths will continue to rise, as this crisis is NOT an over prescribing issue.

I am disabled, I am 56 and have been disabled since I was 40, I have had 9 spinal surgeries and have lots of hardware stabilizing my spine, it continues to degenerate due to autoimmune diseases so I am left with daily chronic pain that has been managed by the use of opioids. I am a sober person, I hate using any type of medication that messes with my head, I wont use marijuana, I dont like to drink but yet now due to the issues a few people have with opioids in our country I am being taken off of my medications and my pain is increasing and Im being left to suffer. Doctors have spent years and lots of money to learn how to treat their patients, yes perhaps there are some bad ones out there and they should be removed from practice and maybe there are some people that have abused their drugs but NOT everyone! I have never asked to have my medication dose increased, nor have I ran out before I am to get my refill, I am just a mother, daughter and a grandmother that wants to have some happiness in her life, to live without suffering, to have some quality of life, to play with my dogs and spend time in my garden. Taking this issue to the pharmacies and to the government to decide is unfair to the patients that are truly suffering, but just because they don't have cancer now they wont get treated for their chronic pain, where is the humanity in this? Who has the right to decide my pain isnt real, I assure you if you looked at my body with the multitude of scars and the nuts and bolts sticking out of my back, you would be assured that it is truly real

"1185","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I'm a chronic pain patient with multiple diseases that cause severe pain. I've been in pain management for over 15 years. Your proposed regulation will severely damage my health care.  Pain medicine including opioids allows for management of my incurable pain and for increased function. 
I've already experienced interference from my Medicare Part D insurance company that has in my opinion harassed my pharmacist and me by asking rude and personal questions such as whether I'm paying my co-pays apparently because the pain medicine is so expensive, or so I'm told. If CMS enforces a hard limit for opioid doses per day, this will give private insurance companies and pharmacies  an excuse to stop paying for my necessary prescriptions or dispensing them at all. 

Where is the science that backs up the regulation decision? Sadly, there is none. And yet if enacted these policies will force even more doctors away from treating pain and at the same time force more patients onto disability. 

My last pain management doctor closed his practice because he knew he would be wrongly judged by the DEA to be a pill mill. Why? Because of the severe shortage of pain management physicians doctors like him are overworked and have too many patients since there are not enough doctors to go around. And because opioids and other pain medicines are less expensive than other forms of treatment, health insurance such as Medicare only pays for the pills rather than the other more costly treatments. This makes pain management physicians like him look like ""pill mills"" when in reality it makes perfect sense why there are so many dispensed pills. In other words damned if you do and damned if you don't. 

It's absurd to ask a very ill patient who is often incapacitated by fatigue and pain to visit their doctor and pharmacy every seven days rather than thirty days as suggested in the regulations. (I do hope you realize that because opioid prescriptions must be hand delivered and not phoned in). My illness is already a full time job but this policy will force severely ill patients of all people (!) to jump through even more hoops.  Without pain medicine I will no longer be able to function and will have to rely on the care of a full time health aid because I won't be able to stand or sit for more than five minutes at a time. The pain is too severe for me to function without medicine or some miracle treatment I am as of yet unaware of. 
 
The policy will create more demand for emergency room services and increase the rate of expensive and often ineffective surgical procedures. As it stands now some doctors feel compelled to only prescribe opioids in conjunction with procedures such as injections that other patients have  told me do not help to alleviate their pain. I personally have had injections in both my feet, my neck, and lower back/legs with relief only from the one injection in my neck. The rest did not help at all and in fact one set of injections in my feet caused severe pain for a short time. And yet Medicare pays 80% for all of these procedures.

This is ridiculous I've had severe chronic pain for 23+ years. I try to get the most inexpensive medication available to help keep costs low. I have been on high-dose opioids as I had traumatic spine fractures at L4 and L5, The dept. specialist gave me a 60% chance of not making it thru surgery without being confined to bed, and/or crippled the rest of my life. He also stated flatly that he wouldn't do surgery because of the odds.
I take 240-mg daily of Oxycodone, and have been at that amount on this one off-brand opioid for 10+ years. I spend every single day trying to get the pain lower, even at this amount it's lowering pain is progressive, but starting in the afternoon I can start becoming more mobile DAILY. 
This is every single day, because any time I sleep the pain level goes up, and most of the time that can happen in 3 hours of sleep. I understand that, as I am moving in ways I shouldn't when I sleep. Sleep of any real length is rarely above 4 hours. A vast majority of the time I sleep in ""shifts"" of 13/4 to 2-3 hours and then am awake again, pain level higher, and hurting and/or trying to sleep again, if I am lucky! If I am at a lower amount of pain it's hard then to fall asleep, so I have to accept a severe sleeping problem. BUT these meds work for me, they are my life! 

My neighbors and luckily two very good friends (and neighbors) consistently come and visit, they help me so much it's embarrassing. But with how the government has started to treat chronic pain patients, and all of the suicides that you hear have happened within the pain patient online community, It's just appalling, worse the major media coverage is 'hyped' and distorted half-facts.  and even the government has  YET to put in an effort to listen to all the various groups of seriously, chronically ill people, who absolutely and through no fault of their own have some condition or malady. 

Yet more and more pain patients are being abandoned and forced to live with intolerable pain.  Quite frankly many ""ordinary "" people would just give up as they too, become forgotten victims. 
These regulations and restrictions are quite frankly not well thought out. This is doing serious damage to legitimate pain patients who live in non-stop pain; and in effect, carries their family members and friends, become witness to other serious health conditions that will ultimately damage the chronically ill population even more. They get a front seat to this mistreatment, and that will do the ultimate damage. 

In the end though this will leave even costing the insurance companies more money, making insurance premiums rise more for all once again, because of the shortsightedness and ultimately cruel rules and regulations that are being allowed to come into being. Many more chronically ill people will justly feel abandoned and ultimately and even more sadly you can be sure that there will be many living in ultimately abject pain and be put in life-crisis situations where suicide actually seems like the ""ultimate solution"" which happens just because of these rushes to continue to let people suffer needlessly. Does anyone want to think that they knowingly had the power not only question but also had the power to end these cruel practices?

On behalf of over 5400 adult day services (ADS) providers and the families they serve, the National Adult Day Services
Association (NADSA) commends CMS for its proposal to expand the scope of the primarily health related supplemental 
benefit standard (pp. 182-183) to benefits that enhance beneficiaries' quality of life and improve health outcomes. We believe 
adult day services meets the broader definition of ""primarily health related"" and we strongly encourage CMS to issue guidance
to include ADS in plan offerings.
  
The primary purpose of adult day services is to reduce avoidable and emergency healthcare utilization by providing 
person-centered, comprehensive maintenance and skilled services up to seven days per week, 12 hours per day, in a 
supervised, congregated setting. Adult day services generally fall into two models, social adult day care (SADC) and adult day 
health care (ADHC). SADC services include supervision, socialization, healthy and nutritious meals, therapeutic activities and 
some or total assistance with personal care. ADHC models further provide skilled nursing, medication management, personal 
care, and therapeutic activities. Some centers also provide restorative and maintenance physical, occupational, and speech 
therapies, psychological and dietary counseling services. Most centers provide transportation, social work and care 
management services to ameliorate functional and psychological impact of injuries or chronic health conditions. These 
services are generally provided at a per-diem rate, which is much lower, and has more benefit, than providing individual 
services in the home. Simply being in the center provides a safe, supervised and socially stimulating environment which 
reduces chronic isolation often experienced by older adults and supports the overall physical, cognitive and mental health 
of the beneficiary.

Across the nation, ADS beneficiaries have experienced reductions of avoidable hospitalizations and delayed nursing home 
placement. A study by the New York State Department of Health credited the continuous health monitoring and health 
education provided in medical model adult day programs with the findings that 70% of participants with multiple chronic 
conditions had no hospitalizations over the course of a 12-month period. Managed care organizations, private insurers, and 
legislators such as Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ben Cardin and Reps. Linda Sanchez and Lee Zeldin have also recognized 
value of ADS in legislation (S.309; H.R.1005; H.R.3098).

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on CMS-2017-0163-0007. We strongly encourage CMS to recognize and to

"1190","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"I am a chronic pain patient who is on permanent disability. I have had 5 back surgeries and 2 neck surgeries, migraines, Fibromyalgia, Restless Legs Syndrome (neurological sleep and movement disorder) and have to use these medications to even function. I am 62 yrs old, take care of my  90 yr old mother. I need to be able to function. My doctor and I have worked to reduce my meds down to the 90 MME, and I am not functioning as well as I was before the reduction of meds. The meds I need to function are extended release morphine, Tramadol and a sleep med, plus others. I have tried and failed over the years with conservative measures such as massage, tens units, nerve ablations, acupuncture, a lot of physical therapy, meditation, and anything else one can think of. I also have infected ulcers, which cuts out all over the counter pain meds, except for Tylenol, which does not touch the refractory pain, nor can it help with the severe sleep deprivation. I have seen up close and personal what reducing or completely taking meds away from a patient can do. I have a narcotics contract (for the last 16 years) use one doctor for ALL meds, do random urine screening, pill counts. In other words my doctor and I have followed EVERY rule. I manage online groups for pain and sleep, and have done many suicide watches. These regulations will have a very negative effect, and the opposite of what is trying to be accomplished will happen here, and has been for months. This is how it goes- people who have been completely functionable, are now finding they cannot work, cannot contribute to society like they used to, and are getting desperate. This will cause people to go over to illegal drugs to try to be able to live, then the overdoses will go up from street drugs NOT down. Most of the illegal fentanyl comes through the mail from China. Cutting off patients and scaring them, plus scaring doctors with guidelines is not the way to do this. The people who follow all the rules meticulously are being punished for the people who do NOT follow the rules, This is unfair, it is not great pain management, and I, for one, have tried everything that anyone can  mention to me as far as non med solutions. Pain meds are the LAST thing I have left. If Medicare does not pay for my meds, my life will go downhill, I will not be able to care for my elderly mother, I will not be able to help my sleep disorders and pain groups, which I HAVE been doing for 28 years. Opiate prescribing has gone down the last 5 years not up, so changing everything around is not conducive to the pain community. I know many people who have has to stop working, their pain is unmanageable now. My doctor KNOWS me, she consults with my other doctors and she alone prescribes ALL of my meds. SHE alone knows my complicated issues, and she is the one who should be able to treat me, not some insurance company. Doctors who follow EVERY rule should be left alone to treat their long time patients. No insurance company should be ""practicing medicine"". They do not know me.  The CDC guidelines should not be ""one size fits all"". People have different pain thresholds, so what works for one person with the guidelines may not work for the next person. We have reduced my meds to follow the guidelines, and now I am doing less and less every day and that is not acceptable to me. I would never go to the streets. Chronic refractory pain actually causes physical brain damage over time, blood pressure goes up. I never had high blood pressure until pain meds were reduced in half, and now have to take 2 blood pressure meds. I take all my meds strictly according to the directions and never deviate, I do not do illegal drugs, and have not consumed alcohol for 40 years. I am 62 yrs old. I am only trying to survive day by day, and I see it everywhere. MY doctor needs to treat me as she sees fit, she is the one that knows me, CMS and Medicare do not know me. I have read all the studies and the new polices do not accurately depict the big picture. Taking people's pain meds will increase costs to Medicare in the end, more overdoses, more urgent care costs and so on. PLEASE think hard about this. The guidelines have already hurt a lot of people, and I cannot reduce any more. I cannot sleep at night now because of my pain, and sleep deprivation kills, pure and simple. The CDC ignored their PR firm, they talked to ONE pain doctor. Dr, Lynn Webster, and it is outside of the rules. These guidelines are not law, and deep in the recesses of the FDA, DEA, and CDC web site are proof that there are way more heroin overdose, with illegal fentanyl than opiates. That is a fact. I do my research, and there are no proven or proper studies that show LEGAL opiates cause more overdoses than heroin. My whole point is that people who follow the rules to the letter are being punished erroneously. It is not good medical practice and Medicare/CMS should not be telling me how to live my life, when all i am trying to do is make it.","CMS-2017-0163","Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year (CY) 2019 for the Medicare Advantage (MA)","Nonrulemaking","CMS-2017-0163-0577","Posted","Public Submission",1,FALSE,"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","Donna McLellan-VT"

have seen pseudo-addiction and I have of course seen opioid tolerance, but those are not reasons make it harder to obtain 
opioids for palliative medicine/hospice patients!
Any rule that impairs a hospice or palliative care patient's ability to receive opioids will cause great harm. Many have come to 
palliative medicine specialists because their pain is poorly controlled, often because their oncologist or other treating physician
has reached an idiosyncratic ""opioid ceiling"" that she is unwilling to go above. That idiosyncratic ceiling however is already 
above the 90 mg/24 hour MME mentioned. As palliative medicine specialists however, we are able to improve their pain control 
often within a few days to a week with a variety of interventions, including higher doses of opioids. These patients will need 
these opioids the rest of their lives, whether it is a few weeks or months on hospice, or hopefully years on our palliative care 
service. Some may achieve enduring remissions or cures and when that has happened, I have never had trouble tapering the
opioids.

I was a highly talented executive in the IT field with a full life  until I experienced failed back surgery for Spondylolisthesis and Facet Arthritis which shut me down from a normal life. No housework, no long walks, no travel and a ruined social life. The only thing allowing me to get around somewhat were a spinal cord stimulator and managed prescriptions of Oxycodone.

I am now facing the totally unjust demonization of my requirement for Opiods.  The so-called drug epidemic we are having in this country originates from two sources: drug addicts and illegal street drugs frequently emanating from Mexico and China.

As a pain patient, I now have my renowned Pain Management Specialist in a world-class NYC hospital, tell me he can no longer prescribe enough medication to cover my pain.  He also shared that several of his colleagues in pain management were in danger of losing their licenses for treating their pain patients.

The recent statement from AG Jeff Sessions telling us pain sufferers, in effect, to just ""deal with it"" is a disgrace to humanity.  I am a Christian but how can I not secretly hope that Mr. Sessions will one day experience a condition of intractable pain, only to be told to """"deal with it""?

I have already had to find a new dr, reduce the amount I was on, and just recently had to change the type of meds as well.  Now my insurance that I have been paying the same premiums for for many many years, has decided that they wont cover some of my meds either.

I went from 2 dr appts a year at $30 ea co pay to 12 per yr at $60 ea co pay.  The amount of meds covered is under half.  The gas in my car, the lost time at work, all this has done is cost me so much more money!!  I may be on medicare some day, I know people on medicare now.  Most people on medicare dont have the means of any extra cash to cover all these added expenses. I have a paycheck and look what has happened to me?  Why shoudl I have to be charged all this extra money just because I am on opiates in order to WORK??  Thats all I want to do is keep my job.

Ive lost so many jobs before I was on meds to keep my pain at a level that is tolerable.  Its been 10 yrs at this job.  I am 50 yrs old, I cant imagine losing my job due to pain control and have to go find a job at this age with these pains.

Ive tried all types of therapy before using opitates.  Injections, other meds, chiro, water therapy, physical thereapy, etc etc.  I didnt even get treated after ea of my injuries.  They just got worse as I aged.  Now Im miserable.  but I am at least working with controlled pain.  Thats all any of us want.

Please reconsider the dosages, removing them, etc.  We are all different.  What works for one, doesnt work for the other.  There is no cookie cutter pain patient. All of our pain is from different sources, reasons, injuries, etc.  Pain levels are all different, controlled by diff doses, types of pill, patch, etc.  Metabolism is all different in each person as well.

WE all, including YOU either know someone or ourselves will be injured or in pain some day.....it only takes a vehicle accident, a work accident, a new child is born into the family with disease, chronic illness, pain, etc etc.  DONT YOU want them to be taken care of???  think about your future, your childrens future, your childrens childrens future, etc etc.

Most pain patients are not abusing these meds!  Addicts are abusing street drugs or any drugs they can find.  Pain patients keep their meds locked up, they cant run out or wont have any, we do not share, we dont even tell everyone what we are on.  I drive around before leaving the pharmacy so no one follows me home, its a scary place out there.

"1199","CMS",FALSE,0,NA,NA,"While this proposal may seem to be a logical response to the opioid problem in the U.S, it is in fact a policy that will lead to untold suffering and suicide within the chronic pain population. I suffer from incessant pain in my cervical spine. Until last year my only challenge was finding the right combination of therapies and pain medications to allow me the function in a very limited way. For two years, before being prescribed a therapeutic dose of daily opiods, and receiving quarterly epidural injections, I spent 90% of my waking hours laying down to unload the weight of my head from my cervical spine. It was a horrible existence. Opioid pain medication and conservative therapies prescribed by a caring and experienced physician now allow me the chance to reclaim a semblance of my life before a bicycle accident laid waste to my cervical spine. My opioid prescription is well above the 90 mg MEU recommendation of the CDC. 

I so fear that my doctor's well thought out and well monitored opioid prescription will be cut to a non-theraputic level, forcing me back onto the couch, with unrelenting pain. I'm too young to spend decades in this condition. People like me, in desperation, will pursue anything to stop our pain, including, as a last desperate resort, suicide. I urge you to create a working group of medical professionals, that include pain specialty, to study in a legitimate, science-based way, what will be the impact of these proposed changes on chronic pain patients. It is insufficient to simply request the input of the public making your decision. Do the right thing and make a fact-based decision, as opposed to a decision based upon the input of organizations that have conflicts of interest (ex. medical device manufacturers, addiction treatment centers, chiropractic physicians, etc.). Real lives will be affected by your decision.

I am a disabled American and I take opioid medication in order to function somewhat normally. I urge you to not go forward with this measure to restrict opioid dosage. Patients with intractable pain are being harmed by the Opioid Crisis hysteria perpetrated by the media and politicians. Even as opioid prescribing continues to go down, deaths attributed to opiods continue to rise. Prescription opioids alone contribute to only a small number of overdose deaths. Also, data and research show that only a small percentage of chronic pain patients develop addition or opioid use disorder. Medical decisions should be made on a patient by patient basis and not determined by CMS. Many pain management doctors are already afraid to prescribe more than 90 mme after the CDC recommendations, that were intended for primary care doctors were released in 2016. My own doctor reduced my dosage recently and said it is just not worth it to prescribe more because of the hoops he has to jump through and because he feared peaking the interest of the DEA. Please do not go forward with this measure that would make life even harder for intractable pain patients and the doctors.

This pain arises from damage or dysfunction of parts of the nervous system.  Sometimes this is being prescribed in addition to narcotics. This can lower the amount of opiate needed because it adds a different mechanism of pain relief.  There is no good reason for CMS to take up the issue of gabapentin use. 

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen are often contraindicated in Medicare (often senior) patients because of chronic kidney disease or risk of GI bleed or use of anti-coagulants.  So, even though these medications can be very helpful in treating inflammation and pain, they are quite dangerous to a large number of patients!

Tylenol has hepatic toxicity at doses barely above recommended doses.  This medication can be helpful for mild to moderate pain in many, but not all people.  

Last week as I was leaving the oral surgeon's office after a procedure that was likely to cause me a lot of pain within a few hours, I asked the dental assistant about pain medication.  She said to take Tylenol and ibuprofen, together or alternating.  Unfortunately I can't take ibuprofen.  So, I was left with Tylenol and ice only.  I did not get much rest that night.  

Had I been given a prescription for a few tablets of a low potency opiate, I would have suffered less.  But, I understand why I wasn't given a prescription.  Medical professionals are being pushed to avoid prescribing opiates, and many patients are suffering because of it.  

Obviously, some medications like fentanyl should not have been available for outpatient use.  The risks are too high for the benefit that could be achieved. 

 I wish that a lot more would be done to control the illegal diversion of opiates from manufacturers and to cut off supplies of non-pharmaceutically produced street drugs.  And Federal Government should stop unreasonably restricting opiate manufacturing because it is causing shortages in operating rooms as well as in pharmacies.
