The issue of regulation of opioid agents for Medicare recipients is going to have the total opposite effect on Medicare both medically and financially.  
Preventing Medicare members from getting appropriate pain relief medications will force them to use more emergent care facilities and or more frequent visits to their own providers to gain access to the pain relief.  Although it is agreed that SOME Medicare members are addicted to opioids and SOME may have started their addiction from prescribed opioids thru their medical providers for needed services the reality is this group of citizens is not the focus group for drug addiction and this regulation is counterproductive.
The only thing that this is going to do is drive the members, in real need, to seek opioids in either nefarious ways or force some to pay out of pocket or remain in pain or as I suggested seek care in "Ready-care" type facilities or even actual EDs when the pain can no longer be tolerated
Tying our hands as clinicians is the wrong approach.  We need access to drugs that can be EASILY accessed to help these as well as all patients.  We are fine with limiting the initial numbers of pain medications for post-surgical or post event-related situations BUT we then need to have drugs approved thru the DEA for us to easily aid the patients when the small amount of initial opioids has been insufficient and they truly do need more
We used to have this in the form of Vicodin (hydrocodone) but when it was moved from Schedule 3 to 2 we lost the ability to call in the drug for either after hours or weekend or other such need.  Now the ONLY way to assist a patient in pain is to physically see them which costs them more and doesn't stop the prescription of the drug.  Surely this bill isn't trying to totally prevent a patient in pain from getting their drug so what is the intent once the small number is exceeded and more is in need?  Surely the answer is not "let them suffer"
We need a comprehensive solution NOT a knee-jerk penalty based response that shifts the blame rather than helping the needy and monitoring the otherwise potential addict.
